# Cybersecurity Threat Landscape & Mitigation Briefing - February 3, 2025

## Executive Summary:

This briefing consolidates information from multiple sources, painting a picture of the current cybersecurity landscape. Key themes include: a surge in ransomware attacks targeting diverse sectors (healthcare, manufacturing, technology), increasing sophistication of malware and phishing tactics leveraging AI, state-sponsored cyber espionage and influence operations, and a growing focus on data governance and security in AI applications. The briefing highlights the need for robust security solutions, proactive threat hunting, international cooperation, and a focus on provenance and trust in digital content.

## I. Key Threat Actors and Campaigns:

### Ransomware Groups: 
BianLian, Medusa, and Arcus Media are actively deploying ransomware, leading to significant disruptions and data breaches.
Mizuno USA experienced a breach resulting in theft of personal information, with BianLian claiming responsibility.
El Cruce hospital in Argentina is threatened with the release of 760GB of patient data by Medusa unless a $200K BTC ransom is paid.
Slovakia’s Land Registry suffered a major ransomware attack, with hackers demanding millions of euros.

### State-Sponsored Actors:Russia (GRU): 
Involved in cyberattacks on Estonia, disinformation campaigns targeting elections in multiple European countries (Croatia, Germany, Poland), and cyberespionage against Central Asian diplomatic entities.
“On January 27, the EU sanctioned three Russian individuals linked to GRU Unit 29155 for 2020 cyberattacks on Estonia, targeting ministries and stealing sensitive data."
"Poland identifies GRU-linked threat group targeting upcoming presidential election in May 2025...through disinformation and recruitment campaigns."

### Iran: 
Strengthening cybersecurity cooperation with Russia, which includes "expertise-sharing on national internet control and cybercrime prevention."

### North Korea (Lazarus Group): 
Engaged in financially motivated attacks, particularly targeting Web3 and cryptocurrency developers ("Operation 99").
Also using IT workers to steal source code for extortion from US companies.

### China (Flax Typhoon): 
Targeting US critical infrastructure; the US is sanctioning companies supporting them.

### Ukrainian Hacktivists: 
Claiming responsibility for attacks disrupting Russian infrastructure, including Nodex (ISP) and Lukoil.

### Hacktivist Groups: 
NoName057(16), a pro-Russia group, is conducting DDoS attacks on European entities, citing support for Ukraine as the cause.

### Emerging Malware:
Xloader malware (successor to Formbook), employing enhanced obfuscation and encryption for data theft.
“It establishes persistence by copying itself to specific directories, modifying Windows registry entries, and using process injection.”
Windows Locker ransomware, recently found on GitHub, encrypts files and modifies registry keys to hinder recovery.
TorNet, a new backdoor targeting Poland and Germany, utilizing the TOR network for stealthy communication.

## II. Key Attack Vectors & Techniques:

### Ransomware: 
Remains a pervasive threat, impacting a broad spectrum of organizations.

### Phishing: 
Increasingly hyper-targeted, utilizing AI to create personalized and culturally relevant emails.
“Using AI to aid their reconnaissance efforts, threat actors will create context-rich, culturally relevant phishing communications that are tailored to local languages..."

### Supply Chain Attacks: 
Compromising software and hardware providers to gain access to customer networks, as suggested in the case of Wacom.

### Living off the Land (LOLBins): 
Attackers exploit legitimate Windows tools for malicious purposes, making detection more difficult.
"Living off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) present a significant challenge for modern security solutions...commonly exploited by malware to perform malicious actions while avoiding detection."

### AI-Driven Attacks: 
Threat actors use AI agents for reconnaissance and to execute attacks at speed, including deployment within botnets for discovering vulnerabilities.
"In the future, we anticipate adversaries using AI agents for a multitude of activities, such as deploying AI agents within botnets that are actively discovering Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVEs)."

### Brute-Force Attacks: 
Using techniques like FastHTTP to target Microsoft 365 accounts via the Graph API, often including MFA spamming to exploit "MFA fatigue".

### Spearphishing: 
Using techniques like QR codes in emails, targeting WhatsApp accounts.

### Malicious Browser Extensions: 
Exploiting development environments, such as Visual Studio Code, via malicious extensions.

## III. Impacted Sectors:

### Healthcare: 
Hospitals (El Cruce), blood centers (New York Blood Center Enterprises), and healthcare providers (Community Health Center (CHC)) are heavily targeted.

### Manufacturing: 
Mizuno USA and other large manufacturers.

### Technology: 
Tata Technologies and other tech companies.

### Government: 
Land Registries, various Ministries, Educational institutions, Election infrastructure, and Diplomatic services.

### Education: 
Eindhoven University of Technology and Israeli kindergartens.

### Telecommunications: 
ISPs (Nodex), telecom companies, and undersea cables are targets.

### Energy: 
Lukoil and other energy entities.

### Financial: 
Banks, trading firms, and individuals are targets for financial gain.

### Transportation: 
Car manufacturers and transportation-related entities.

### Critical infrastructure: 
Including energy and transportation.

## IV. Security Recommendations & Solutions:

### Proactive Cybersecurity Measures:
"We are confident that the incoming national security and cybersecurity team is ready to forcefully counter adversarial cyber activity...fight the proliferation of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure...protect American intellectual property; and embrace AI innovation as a critical enabler of cyber resilience."
Organizations must focus on robust security solutions (XDR, endpoint protection, threat intel).
Need for real time detection.

### XDR Platforms:
Consider native sensor solutions for rapid deployment and comprehensive visibility.
"Native sensors offer faster deployment, real-time detection, and deeper visibility, while integrations may add complexity and delays."

### Data Governance for AI:
Implement robust data authorization mechanisms, especially in generative AI applications, using metadata filtering and secure API calls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data in RAG implementations.
"The data sent to the LLM should include only data the principal is authorized to have access to. LLM and guardrail features are probabilistic, and therefore they should not be used to make data authorization decisions."
Focus on data visibility, access control, quality assurance, and ownership.

### Content Provenance: 
Utilize technologies like Content Credentials to preserve information about the origin and modifications of digital content.
"If you’ve enabled the Preserve Content Credentials setting in Cloudflare, then that metadata is now preserved in Cloudflare Images."

### Incident Response and Threat Hunting: 
Essential for quickly responding to and mitigating attacks.

### Employee Training: 
Organizations should train employees to recognize and avoid sophisticated phishing attempts.

### International Cooperation: 
Collaboration is crucial to combating cybercrime and state-sponsored attacks. The EU and US have imposed sanctions on various entities.
"The EU and US impose sanctions on Russian, Iranian, Chinese, and North Korean entities for cyberattacks, election interference, and espionage, targeting individuals, companies, and state-linked groups."

### Independent Testing & Certification: 
Helps in choosing security solutions.
"Independent testing organizations like AVLab play a critical role in establishing trust and transparency in the cybersecurity industry."

## V. Emerging Trends & Concerns:

- AI-powered attacks represent a significant and growing threat.
- Malicious AI agents automating portions of the cyber kill chain.
- The use of multi-signature wallet scams for cryptocurrency fraud.
- "The catch is that the bait is set up as a multi-signature wallet. To authorize outgoing transactions in such wallets, approval from two or more people is required, so transferring USDT to a personal wallet won’t work."
- Increased use of commercial spyware, as highlighted by the UN Security Council's discussion.
- The ongoing tension in the context of the Ukraine war and Russian state actors and associated influence operations.
- Compromise of software supply chains such as through malicious browser extensions in development environments.
