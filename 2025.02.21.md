# Cyber Threat Landscape: 2025.02.21

## Executive Summary:

This briefing summarizes recent cybersecurity threats and trends, including ransomware attacks, state-sponsored espionage, healthcare security vulnerabilities, LLM jailbreaking, and account takeovers (ATO). Key findings include the Black Basta ransomware gang experiencing internal conflict and a data leak, Chinese hackers targeting US telecom networks with custom malware, persistent healthcare security lapses, vulnerabilities in generative AI models, a patched Microsoft Power Pages vulnerability, and a resurgence of the Angry Likho APT targeting Russian organizations, and prevalent account takeover attempts across various industries.

## 1. Black Basta Internal Chat Leak (Source: The Register):

### Key Theme:
- Internal conflict within the Black Basta ransomware group leading to a significant data leak of internal chat logs.

### Details:
- Hundreds of thousands of internal messages from the Black Basta ransomware gang were leaked by a Telegram user.
- The leak is attributed to internal conflicts, with one figure, "Tramp," playing a major role in the group's instability. "As part of our continuous monitoring, we've observed that Black Basta (Vengeful Mantis) has been mostly inactive since the start of the year due to internal conflicts,"
- The leaker claimed the data was released because the group was targeting Russian banks. "On February 11, 2025, a major leak exposed Black Basta internal Matrix chat logs. The leaker claimed they released the data because the group was targeting Russian banks. This leak closely resembles the previous Conti leaks."
- The leaked messages span from September 2023 to September 2024.
### Highlights from the chats indicate: 
- ransom demands in the tens of millions, charging around $1 million for a year's access to its loader, targeting critical infrastructure, and awareness within the group that its ransomware was less effective than rivals.
- "It was known within the group that its ransomware was less effective than rivals, which drove some affiliates to join Cactus ransomware instead."
### Victims included: 
- The UK's Southern Water, Healthcare company Synlab Italia, US Catholic healthcare network Ascension, Jet engine dealer Willis Lease Finance, Belgian beer slinger Duvel Moortgat, Hyundai Europe, Veolia North America, Government of Chile's customs department, Toronto Public Library.
- An AI tool "BlackBastaGPT" has been created to analyze the leaked data.

## 2. Chinese Hackers Target US Telecoms:

### Key Theme: 
Chinese state-sponsored hacking group (Salt Typhoon) using custom malware to spy on US telecom networks.

### Details:
- The hacking group, active since at least 2019, has breached government entities and telecommunications companies. "Salt Typhoon (aka Earth Estries, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286) is a sophisticated hacking group active since at least 2019, primarily focusing on breaching government entities and telecommunications companies."
- Salt Typhoon has successfully breached telecommunication service providers in the U.S., including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies, and T-Mobile.
- They managed to tap into private communications of some U.S. government officials and stole information related to court-authorized wiretapping requests.
- They are using a custom utility called "JumbledPath" to monitor network traffic and potentially capture sensitive data. "The Chinese state-sponsored Salt Typhoon hacking group uses a custom utility called JumbledPath to stealthily monitor network traffic and potentially capture sensitive data in cyberattacks on U.S. telecommunication providers."
- The group infiltrates networks primarily through stolen credentials.
- "No new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign,"

## 3. Healthcare Security Lapses:

### Key Theme: 
- Persistent security vulnerabilities in the healthcare sector leading to data breaches.

### Details:
- The healthcare sector is identified as one of the worst at protecting sensitive information. "Healthcare is one of the sectors that has the most sensitive information about us. At the same time it’s one of the worst at keeping them secret."

### Recommendations include: 
checking vendor's advice after a breach, changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, watching out for fake vendors, taking your time with communications, and not storing card details on websites.

## 4. LLM Jailbreaking:

### Key Theme: 
Investigation into the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques against popular generative AI web products.

### Details:
- The research evaluated 17 popular GenAI web products for vulnerabilities to jailbreaking.
- Jailbreaking techniques aim to bypass guardrails designed to prevent the generation of unsafe content or the leakage of sensitive data. "Large language models (LLMs) typically include guardrails to prevent users from generating content considered unsafe (such as language that is biased or violent). Guardrails also prevent users from persuading the LLM to communicate sensitive data, such as the training data used to create the model or its system prompt. Jailbreaking techniques are used to bypass those guardrails."
- Multi-turn jailbreak strategies are generally more effective than single-turn approaches at achieving AI safety violations (e.g., generating hateful content, self-harm instructions, malware). "Multi-turn strategies achieve a high ASR for AI safety violation goals"
- "Simple single-turn attacks remain effective"
- The tested apps generally have strong resilience against training data and PII data leakage attacks. "The tested apps in general have strong resilience against training data and and PII data leakage attacks"
- "DAN" jailbreaking techniques are becoming less effective due to enhanced alignment measures in current model deployments.
- Key jailbreak strategies evaluated: DAN, Role play, Storytelling, Payload smuggling, Instruction Override, Repeated token, Crescendo, and Bad Likert Judge.
- Attack Success Rate (ASR) was used to measure the effectiveness of jailbreak techniques.

## 5. Microsoft Power Pages Vulnerability:

### Key Theme: 
Microsoft patched an exploited Power Pages privilege escalation vulnerability.

### Details:
- The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24989, allowed attackers to "elevate privileges over a network potentially bypassing the user registration control."
- Microsoft has not shared any information on the attacks exploiting this vulnerability.
- "This vulnerability has already been mitigated in the service and all affected customers have been notified"

## 6. Angry Likho APT:

### Key Theme: 
Resurgence of the Angry Likho APT group targeting Russian organizations with a focus on data theft.

### Details:
- The group has been monitored since 2023 and shares similarities with Awaken Likho. "Angry Likho (referred to as Sticky Werewolf by some vendors) is an APT group we’ve been monitoring since 2023. It bears a strong resemblance to Awaken Likho, which we’ve analyzed before, so we classified it within the Likho malicious activity cluster."
- Attacks are targeted, focusing on employees of large organizations, including government agencies and their contractors.
- The group uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments (RAR archives containing LNK files and bait files). "The initial attack vector used by Angry Likho consists of standardized spear-phishing emails with various attachments."
- In June 2024, a new implant named FrameworkSurvivor.exe was discovered, acting as a self-extracting archive.
- The group's latest attacks use the Lumma stealer to collect sensitive data. "The Lumma stealer gathers system and installed software information from the compromised devices, as well as sensitive data such as cookies, usernames, passwords, banking card numbers, and connection logs."
- Activity surged in January 2025, with new attacks likely in preparation since at least January 16, 2025.
- "We attribute this campaign to the APT group Angry Likho with a high degree of confidence."
- Victims are primarily in Russia, with some in Belarus.
- The attack techniques remain relatively consistent over time.

## 7. Account Takeover Statistics:

### Key Theme: 
Widespread prevalence of account takeover (ATO) attacks across industries.

### Details:
- In 2024, 99% of customer tenants monitored were targeted for account takeovers.
- 62% of these organizations experienced at least one account takeover, with an average of 12.
- Top source countries for ATO attacks: United States, Germany, Russia, India, and the Netherlands.
- Top domain sources for ATO attacks: Datacamp.co.uk, Microsoft.com, Amazon.com, Biterika.ru and Cyberassets.ae.
- "One clear takeaway is that geo or domain blocking is not sufficient to defend against account takeover attempts."
- ATO attempts are ubiquitous across all industries, with percentages varying only between 95% and 100% of organizations experiencing such attempts. "It’s not an overstatement to say threat actor attempts at account takeovers are ubiquitous across all industries."
