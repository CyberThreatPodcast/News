# Cybersecurity Briefing: Ransomware, Phishing, Linux Persistence, and More

## Executive Summary:

This briefing covers a range of current cybersecurity topics, from ransomware trends and social media account protection to Linux persistence mechanisms, holiday internet traffic patterns, Android phishing, secure access service edge (SASE), and recent vulnerability disclosures. Key findings include the continued fragmentation of the ransomware landscape, increased exploitation of social media accounts, evolving phishing tactics targeting mobile users, and important security patches released by Microsoft and Adobe.

## 1. Ransomware Landscape (Dragos Industrial Ransomware Analysis: Q4 2024):

### Key Theme: 
Fragmentation and Geographic Distribution of Ransomware Attacks
The ransomware ecosystem is increasingly fragmented, with numerous groups active. "Dragos’s analysis of Q4 2024 ransomware activity indicates further fragmentation in the ecosystem."
North America remains the most targeted region, accounting for "approximately 51% of global ransomware activity." Europe follows, with "approximately 28% of global ransomware activities."
Manufacturing and transportation are frequently affected sectors, particularly in Europe and South America.

### Top Ransomware Groups:
LockBit3.0: 
Most active, despite law enforcement efforts. "Accounted for 70 incidents (~12%), maintaining a high level of activity despite law enforcement disruptions earlier in 2024."

Play: 
Focuses on critical infrastructure and industrial victims. "Linked to 63 incidents (~10%). The group continues to focus on critical infrastructure and industrial victims."

RansomHub: 
Aggressive RaaS model targeting industrial organizations. "Reported 56 incidents (~9%), an aggressive RaaS model attracting affiliates from disrupted operations; heavily targets industrial organizations."

## 2. Social Media Account Security (How To Protect Your Organization's Bluesky Account From Security Threats | Rapid7 Blog):

Key Theme: 
- Protecting Bluesky Accounts
- Bluesky is a decentralized social network platform built on the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (ATProto). "Bluesky is a social network platform built on the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (ATProto), an “open, decentralized network for building social applications."

Security Features:
- App passwords for third-party apps: "These are codes generated by Bluesky which you can use for third-party apps, without having to give said apps your Bluesky password."

Logged-out visibility: 
- Option to request users to be logged in before accessing content. "This option requests that users be logged in before being able to access your content."

## 3. Least Privilege Access for Amazon Bedrock (Implementing least privilege access for Amazon Bedrock | AWS Security Blog):

### Key Theme: 

- Implementing Least Privilege for Amazon Bedrock.
- Focus on identity and access management for generative AI. "In this post, we focus solely on the identity and access management aspects."
- Leveraging data perimeters as guardrails, in combination with fine-grained policies, to achieve the principle of least privilege (PoLP). "Because data perimeters are typically coarse grained, they aren’t sufficient to achieve the goal of the PoLP. However, in combination with fine-grained policies, they support a defense-in-depth approach."
- Service roles assumed by the Amazon Bedrock service principal allow for fine-grained and least-privilege access end-to-end. "Amazon Bedrock model customization uses service roles, which allows you to apply fine-grained and least-privilege access end-to-end."
- Examples of IAM policies to control access to models and restrict access to data.
- Importance of using KMS keys and encrypting customized models to limit access to certain KMS keys to Bedrock service roles. "Therefore, you need to grant the same IAM role permissions to create KMS key grants in the KMS key policy. The KMS key you use for this purpose is typically different than the one you used to encrypt the training data to allow fine-grained permissions on both keys."
- Emphasis on preventing the confused deputy problem through the use of aws:SourceAccount and aws:SourceArn global condition context keys. "Both the aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount global condition context keys in the role’s trust policy limit the permissions that Amazon Bedrock gives another service (in the preceding case, to the customization job) to the resource."

## 4. Linux Persistence Mechanisms (Linux Detection Engineering - Approaching the Summit on Persistence Mechanisms — Elastic Security Labs):

### Key Theme: 
- Creative and Complex Linux Persistence Techniques
- Focus on techniques beyond basic persistence. "Building on foundational concepts and techniques explored in the previous publications, this post discusses some creative and/or complex persistence mechanisms."

### Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):
Attackers can modify PAM modules to capture credentials or gain unauthorized access (MITRE ATT&CK T1556.003). "While PAM provides the essential capability to centralize how secure authentication happens, its flexibility can be abused by attackers to establish persistence through malicious PAM modules."
PAM backdoors often patch pam_unix_auth.c. "Commonly, PAM backdoors will patch the pam_unix_auth.c file, which is part of the pam_unix module, a widely used PAM module for UNIX-style password authentication."
pam_exec.so can be abused to execute arbitrary scripts upon authentication. "One way of abusing this mechanism is by leveraging the pam_exec.so module to execute an arbitrary script upon authentication through /etc/pam.d/sshd."

### Installer Packages (DPKG & RPM):
Attackers can use lifecycle scripts (preinst, postinst, etc.) in package managers to execute malicious code (MITRE ATT&CK T1546.016). "These scripts run at different stages of the package lifecycle, making them a potential target for executing malicious commands."

### Malicious Docker Containers:
Attackers can create containers with backdoors and escape mechanisms (MITRE ATT&CK T1610). The escape.sh script, which is granted passwordless sudo permissions, uses nsenter to attach to the host's namespaces (e.g., mount, network, PID) via the init process, effectively breaking container isolation.
Provides ES|QL and OSQuery detection queries to hunt for these techniques.

## 5. Holiday Internet Traffic Patterns (Offline celebrations: how Christmas, NYE, and Lunar New Year festivities shape online behavior):

### Key Theme: 
- Impact of Holidays on Internet Traffic
- Significant drops in internet traffic during major holidays like Christmas, New Year's Eve, and Lunar New Year. "Globally, December 25 saw a 19% drop in traffic from the previous week, followed by December 24 with a 14% drop."
- Christmas Eve is the primary "offline moment" in many European countries. "In Europe, most countries (including Denmark, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Finland, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Poland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, Belgium, and Romania) experience their largest traffic drop on December 24, making Christmas Eve the primary offline moment."
- Orthodox Christmas (January 7) sees increased traffic compared to the days surrounding New Year's.
- Lunar New Year has a major impact on traffic in East and Southeast Asian countries, particularly on January 29. "Daily Internet traffic drops when people disconnected to celebrate across Asia. Hong Kong saw its sharpest decline on January 29 (-25%), while Singapore peaked at -23% on the same day."
- The timing of holidays affects internet traffic patterns. "Hanukkah’s timing changes each year, influencing when people log off. In 2024, Hanukkah started on the evening of December 25, leading to a 5% drop in traffic in Israel, followed by 4% drops on the next two days."

## 6. Mobile Phishing (Phishing evolves beyond email to become latest Android app threat | Malwarebytes):

### Key Theme: 
- Phishing Evolution to Android Apps
- Phishing attacks are increasingly targeting Android users through malicious apps.
- Cybercriminals disguise apps to mimic legitimate communications and steal user credentials. "For more than a decade, phishing was often understood as an email threat. Cybercriminals would send emails disguised as legitimate communications from major businesses, such as Netflix, Uber, Instagram, Google, and more."
- Emphasizes the need for vigilance and safe online behavior to avoid these threats.

## 7. Secure Access Service Edge (SSE) (SSE: What They Won’t Tell You (But I Will) | Symantec Enterprise Blogs):

### Key Theme: 
- SSE Implementation Advice
- Importance of identifying all requirements before demoing SSE solutions. "Uh oh—you haven’t identified all your requirements. In many ways, the demo stage is almost more work for buyers."
- Focus on achieving the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and avoiding scope creep. "Sprint to your MVP with blinders on. Get the transformation win against the MVP definition of success."
- Vendors need to listen to customer needs and execute the software development lifecycle effectively. "Vendors, this one’s for you. That first demo is a chance to display your willingness to really listen to customer needs and execute the SDLC..."

## 8. Sandworm APT Campaign (Sandworm APT Targets Ukrainian Users with Trojanized Microsoft KMS Activation Tools in Cyber Espionage Campaigns):

### Key Theme: 
- Sandworm APT Cyber Espionage Campaign Against Ukraine
- Sandworm (APT44), linked to Russia's GRU, targets Ukrainian Windows users using trojanized KMS activators and fake Windows updates. "EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that Sandworm (APT44) [1], a threat actor supporting Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), is actively conducting a cyber espionage campaign against Ukrainian Windows users."
- Malware deployed includes BACKORDER loader and Dark Crystal RAT (DcRAT). "BACKORDER ultimately deploys Dark Crystal RAT (DcRAT) [3], enabling attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data and conduct cyber espionage."
- BACKORDER loader disables Windows Defender and adds exclusion rules. "BACKORDER loader disables Windows Defender and adds exclusion rules to certain folders via powershell.exe -Command Add-MpPreference –ExclusionPath <Folder-Path> command, preparing the victim’s system for the final DcRAT payload."
- DcRAT exfiltrates sensitive data like screenshots, keystrokes, browser data, FTP credentials, and system information.
- Persistence is achieved through scheduled tasks. "EclecticIQ analysts observed that the DcRAT sample created multiple scheduled tasks to maintain persistent access on the victim’s device by regularly launching the malicious payload."
- A new RDP backdoor named Kalambur was discovered, disguised as a Windows Update. "EclecticIQ analysts observed a new backdoor following the domain pivot. In this case, the threat actor used a domain kalambur[.]net to download a Microsoft Windows Update-themed RDP backdoor."
- The report includes SIGMA rules and IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) for detection.
- References a CERT-UA report about a pirated Microsoft Office version leading to unauthorized access to ICS devices.
- "By leveraging trojanized software to infiltrate ICS environments, Sandworm (APT44) continues to demonstrate its strategic objective of destabilizing Ukraine's critical infrastructure in support of Russian geopolitical ambitions."

## 9. February 2025 Security Updates (Zero Day Initiative — The February 2025 Security Update Review):

### Key Theme: 
- Vulnerability Patches from Microsoft and Adobe
- Microsoft released 57 new CVEs. "This month, Microsoft released 57 new CVEs in Windows and Windows Components, Office and Office Components, Azure, Visual Studio, and Remote Desktop Services."
- Adobe patches address DoS, code execution, and privilege escalation vulnerabilities. "The patch for Substance 3D Stager fixes a single DoS bug. The fix for InCopy is also a single bug, but this one is a Critical-rated code execution."
- Microsoft patches include three Critical-rated vulnerabilities and one Moderate-rated vulnerability.
- Lists important CVEs, including those exploited in the wild.
- Privilege escalation bugs receiving fixes can lead to SYSTEM-level code execution or administrative privileges. "There are a handful of privilege escalation bugs receiving fixes in this month’s release, and most of these either lead to SYSTEM-level code execution or administrative privileges if an authenticated user runs specially crafted code."

## Recommendations:

- Organizations should prioritize patching vulnerabilities identified in the Microsoft and Adobe security updates, especially those listed as exploited in the wild.
- Security teams should review and implement detection rules for the Linux persistence techniques outlined in the Elastic Security Labs report.
- Organizations using Amazon Bedrock should follow the provided guidance to implement least privilege access and protect sensitive data.
- Users should be educated about the dangers of mobile phishing and the importance of downloading apps from trusted sources.
- Network defenders can use holiday internet traffic patterns for threat hunting and incident response context.
