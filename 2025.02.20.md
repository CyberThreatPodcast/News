# Cybersecurity Threat Landscape: Trends, Actors, and Mitigation - 2025.02.20

## Executive Summary:

This briefing summarizes recent cybersecurity threats and trends, including the rise of ransomware, sophisticated attack techniques like "living off the land" (LOTL), the activities of specific threat actors (Kimsuky, Stately Taurus, BlackLock, APT41), and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in popular software and cloud services. Emerging technologies like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) are also highlighted as potential solutions for future security challenges.

## Key Themes & Findings:

## Ransomware Resilience & Evolution:
- Despite law enforcement takedowns, ransomware attacks are on the rise. "Ransomware attacks continued to trend upwards in 2024, rising by 3% compared to 2023, underlining the resilience of this particular cyber threat."
- New ransomware groups like RansomHub and BlackLock are emerging, sometimes filling the void left by disrupted operations like LockBit. BlackLock, in particular, is notable for using custom malware, making analysis more difficult. "While competitor ransomware groups rely on leaked Babuk or LockBit builders to launch attacks, BlackLock sets itself apart by creating its own custom malware."
- LockBit is attempting a comeback with LockBit 4.0, but it remains to be seen if it will regain its dominance. Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has observed LockBit 4.0 being deployed in attacks.

## Sophisticated Attack Techniques:
### Living off the Land (LOTL): 
Threat actors are increasingly using legitimate tools and functionalities already present in the target environment to avoid detection. "A hallmark of this campaign is the use of living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques on network devices." This was observed in the Salt Typhoon campaign against telecommunications companies.

### DLL Sideloading: 
This technique is used to execute malicious code by exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate applications. Several sources mention this technique being used by different threat actors, including the China-linked attackers deploying ShadowPad and the Stately Taurus group with the Bookworm malware.

### Cloud Exploitation: 
Threat actors are creatively exploiting native cloud services for malicious purposes, such as using Amazon S3's Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) for ransom operations.

### Statistical Anti-Evasion: 
Adversaries are using increasingly complex evasions to try and circumvent sandboxing environments.

## Threat Actor Activity & Targeting:
### Kimsuky (North Korea): 
This prolific North Korean group primarily targets South Korean entities for espionage and financial gain. "We observed evidence of both espionage and financial motivation, though leaning more toward espionage," with "consistent targeting of South Korean government agencies, enterprises, and strategic industries." They are known for high-volume phishing campaigns.

### Stately Taurus (Likely China-linked): 
This group is associated with the Bookworm malware and is targeting Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar. The Bookworm malware is evolving, reusing shellcode in different formats.

### APT41 (China): 
This group is associated with the ShadowPad malware, which is being used to target companies in various industries and countries, potentially for intellectual property theft or ransomware deployment. "Shadowpad is a modular malware family discovered in 2017 in a supply chain attack against the NetSarang software. It has been attributed to the Chinese threat actor APT41, before being shared among multiple Chinese threat actors in 2019."

### Salt Typhoon: 
A highly sophisticated threat actor targeting major U.S. telecommunications companies, using LOTL techniques and pivoting between compromised devices.

### NailaoLocker: 
C++-based ransomware used by China-linked attackers. Researchers noted it's "relatively unsophisticated and poorly designed, seemingly not intended to guarantee full encryption."

## Vulnerabilities & Exploits:
### Check Point Flaw: 
China-linked attackers are exploiting a Check Point vulnerability to deploy ShadowPad and ransomware.

### Cisco Vulnerabilities: 
Salt Typhoon is possibly abusing known Cisco vulnerabilities, making patching critical.

### Google Ads Abuse: 
Criminals are using Google Ads to distribute malware, including fake Chrome installers bundled with SecTopRAT.

### FortiClient EMS Vulnerability: 
Attackers are exploiting a patched FortiClient EMS vulnerability in the wild.

## Data Privacy Concerns:
### DeepSeek & ByteDance/TikTok: 
Evidence suggests DeepSeek is sharing user data with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance.

### Google Digital Fingerprinting: 
Google is allowing advertising customers to fingerprint website visitors, raising privacy concerns.

## DDoS Attacks & International Events:
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are frequently used against international assemblies, with telecommunication providers being prime targets.

## Managed Detection and Response (MDR) Insights:
- Kaspersky's MDR data reveals that industrial, financial, and government sectors are the most frequently targeted. However, when considering high-severity incidents, the IT sector becomes a significant target.
- Europe, CIS, and META regions have the largest concentration of MDR customers.

## Quantum Computing & Future Security:
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms are emerging as critical technologies for securing data against future quantum computing threats. "By harnessing the power of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms and advancing QKD technologies, we can secure our data against the threats of the quantum era."

## Recommendations:

### Prioritize Patching: 
Promptly apply security patches for known vulnerabilities in software and network devices.

### Implement Robust Detection & Response: 
Utilize Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services and threat intelligence feeds to proactively identify and respond to threats.

### Strengthen Access Controls: 
Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to limit lateral movement within the network.

### Monitor Network Devices: 
Closely monitor network devices for signs of compromise, including unauthorized configuration changes and suspicious user accounts.

### Enhance Security Awareness: 
Educate users about phishing attacks and other social engineering techniques.

### Adopt Cloud Security Best Practices: 
Implement strong access policies and monitoring for cloud services like Amazon S3.

### Consider Quantum-Safe Encryption: 
Begin evaluating and implementing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to prepare for the future threat of quantum computing.

### Privacy Protection: 
Use VPNs and other privacy-enhancing technologies to limit data collection and digital fingerprinting.
