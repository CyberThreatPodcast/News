Cybersecurity Landscape: Trends and Insights, February 2025

**Executive Summary:**

This briefing consolidates information from multiple sources published on February 25, 2025, highlighting key trends in the cybersecurity landscape. These trends include the increasing focus of attackers on disruption, the growing sophistication and speed of attacks (often AI-assisted), the persistent threat of phishing (also AI-enhanced), the importance of cloud security, the criticality of securing the software supply chain, and the rising dangers in the DeFi space and within mobile app ecosystems. A proactive, "secure by design" approach and comprehensive risk management strategies are essential for organizations to navigate this complex threat environment. Visibility into data risks, and the ability to remediate them is also crucial for success.

**Key Themes and Insights:**

**1. Shift to Disruption-Focused Cyberattacks:**

- Financially motivated attackers are increasingly prioritizing operational disruption (sabotage, system destruction, prolonged downtime) to maximize impact and pressure victims into paying extortion demands. "Financially motivated attackers have shifted their focus to deliberate operational disruption, prioritizing sabotage – destroying systems, locking customers out and causing prolonged downtime – to maximize impact and pressure organizations into paying extortion demands." (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- This shift necessitates a focus on resilience and recovery in addition to traditional prevention and detection strategies.
- 86% of major cyber incidents in 2024 resulted in operational downtime, reputational damage, or financial loss. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)

**2. Accelerated and Sophisticated Attack Landscape:**

- Cyberattacks are moving faster than ever. 25% of incidents involved data exfiltration in under 5 hours, three times faster than in 2021. In one in five cases, data theft occurred in under 1 hour. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- AI is accelerating the attack lifecycle, enabling more convincing phishing, automated malware development, and faster progression through the attack chain. "In a controlled experiment, Unit 42 researchers found that AI-assisted attacks could reduce the time to exfiltration to just 25 minutes." (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- Multipronged attacks are becoming the norm, with 70% of incidents involving attackers exploiting three or more attack surfaces. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)

**3. The Resurgence and Evolution of Phishing:**

- Phishing has resurged as the most common initial access vector, responsible for 23% of all initial access points. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- Generative AI fuels more sophisticated, convincing, and scalable phishing campaigns. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)

**4. Cloud Security Imperatives:**

- Cloud attacks are increasing, with nearly 29% of cyber incidents involving cloud environments. 21% of incidents caused operational damage to cloud environments due to threat actors embedding within misconfigured environments. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- Organizations struggle to track where sensitive data resides in multicloud environments. "Sensitive data is a prime target for attackers, yet security teams often struggle to track where it resides and how exposed it is." (Rapid7, Exposure Command)
- Visibility gaps remain a significant challenge. 40% of cloud incidents stemmed from unmonitored cloud assets and shadow IT. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- Rapid7's Exposure Command offers data classification ingestion, enhanced risk assessment, and proactive remediation steps to secure sensitive information in cloud infrastructures.
- The importance of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for seamless classification, especially with native Terraform resource tagging.

**5. Insider Threats:**

- Insider-driven cyber incidents tied to North Korea tripled in 2024. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)
- North Korean state-sponsored actors infiltrate organizations by posing as IT professionals, introducing backdoors, stealing data, and altering source code. (Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 Report)

**6. Software Supply Chain Security:**

- Organizations must look beyond vulnerability mitigation alone to secure their AppSec. (RL Blog)
- Software complexity is on the rise, making it critical to reduce the overall software footprint. "Remove the programs, apps, binaries, and libraries you don’t use or need. It is exceptionally common to find unnecessary code lurking on endpoints. If it isn’t there, you don’t have to patch it." (Gareth Lindahl-Wise, Ontinue CISO)
- Organizations should harden their application development environments against attacks.
- Targeting the software development supply chain makes the most sense for attackers, given the large attack surface and complexity.
- Software supply chain threats can be categorized as "vulnerable" or "malicious," and current tools mainly focus on the former.

**7. The DeFi Security Landscape:**

- DeFi protocols are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, such as role escalation, resulting in significant financial losses. An attack on the Infini DeFi protocol resulted in the loss of approximately 50 million USDC. (Check Point Research)
- Compromised private keys, manipulation of access controls, and precise transaction sequences can lead to fund drainage.
- Security measures like private key security, role separation, time-locks, monitoring, and withdrawal limits are crucial for DeFi protocols.

**8. Mobile App Security Risks:**

- Malicious apps disguised as legitimate tools can still infiltrate official app stores (e.g., Google Play Store). A "SpyLoan" app called "Finance Simplified" was downloaded 100,000 times and used for predatory lending and data theft/blackmail. (Malwarebytes)
- Even with enhanced security measures, a "cat-and-mouse game" exists between cybercriminals and security measures. (Malwarebytes)
- Users should change passwords, enable 2FA, avoid storing card details, and set up identity monitoring to mitigate the impact of data theft from malicious apps.

**9. Online Seller Scams:**

- Phishing campaigns target online sellers to steal credit card details for payout accounts.
- Scammers pressure sellers to conduct transactions off-platform, removing seller protections. Shipment detail changes and attempted use of "friends and family" payment options are common scam techniques. (Cisco Talos)
- Sellers should avoid using third-party services and stick to platform transaction processes.

**10. AI Agents and Cloudflare:**

- AI agents can autonomously execute tasks by making decisions about tool usage and process flow.
- Cloudflare is positioning itself as a platform for building AI agents, offering tools like agents-sdk and updates to Workers AI. "We truly believe that Cloudflare is the ideal platform for building Agents and AI applications..." (Cloudflare)
- Key features include a platform that only charges for what you use (CPU time), a global network, and ease of scaling.

**11. Secure by Design:**

- The "secure by design" philosophy is gaining momentum, with initiatives like the CISA Secure by Design Pledge. "Secure by design is a foundational approach to product development that vendors must embrace, ensuring that security is a foundational component of the design and development process instead of being applied as an afterthought." (Fortinet)
- Technology vendors must take ownership of customer security outcomes and embrace radical transparency and accountability.
- Technology buyers should demand that vendors embrace secure by design.

**Recommendations:**

- **Adopt a "Secure by Design" approach** to software and system development, prioritizing security from the outset.
- **Implement comprehensive risk management strategies** that consider various attack vectors and potential impacts.
- **Focus on attack surface management** to identify, prioritize, and remediate risks across hybrid environments.
- **Enhance cloud security posture** through visibility, continuous monitoring, and automated data classification.
- **Strengthen software supply chain security** by reducing software footprint, hardening development environments, and using tools that detect both vulnerable and malicious components.
- **Improve user awareness and training** to combat phishing and social engineering attacks.
- **Prioritize private key security** in blockchain applications and implement multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
- **Stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities** through continuous monitoring and threat intelligence feeds.
- **Implement controls at multiple layers** and deploy configurations that best reduce risk within each environment.
- **Leverage AI-driven tools** for vulnerability scoring and predictive risk assessment.
