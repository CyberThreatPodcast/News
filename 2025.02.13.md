# Cybersecurity Threat Briefing: Emerging Trends and Key Threats - 2025.02.13

## Executive Summary:

This document summarizes several emerging and ongoing cybersecurity threats identified across various sources. Key trends include:

- Espionage groups engaging in ransomware attacks.
- Advanced phishing techniques leveraging AI and novel authentication methods.
- Russian influence operations targeting European elections.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in network devices by state-sponsored actors.
- Use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes (LOLBins).
- Malware campaigns leveraging Microsoft Graph API and cloud services for command and control (C2).

## Key Themes and Ideas:

## 1. State-Sponsored Activity and Espionage:

### China (RedMike/Salt Typhoon): 
This group is actively exploiting vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-20198, CVE-2023-20273) in Cisco IOS XE software on network devices, particularly those associated with telecommunications providers globally, including a US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. They add GRE tunnels for persistent access. "RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally." They also target universities, possibly to access research in telecommunications, engineering, and technology. They performed reconnaissance against a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.

### Russia: 
Multiple Russian threat actors are conducting social engineering and spear-phishing campaigns to compromise Microsoft 365 accounts via Device Code Authentication phishing. Emails are often themed around political events and spoof the U.S. Department of State. "Volexity has observed multiple Russian threat actors conducting social-engineering and spear-phishing campaigns targeting organizations with the ultimate goal of compromising Microsoft 365 accounts via Device Code Authentication phishing."
Additionally, the Stimmen aus Moskau report indicates malign influence operations linked to Russia and Russia-based actors are targeting the German federal elections.

## 2. Ransomware and Financially Motivated Attacks:

A China-linked espionage group has been observed using its toolkit to deploy RA World ransomware. This is unusual as China-based groups don't typically engage in financially motivated attacks. A possible explanation was that an actor within the group was attempting to make money on the side. The attacker leveraged the same Toshiba executable (toshdpdb.exe) to sideload the malicious DLL named toshdpapi.dll.
The 8Base ransomware group's infrastructure has been disrupted and leaders have been arrested in an international law enforcement operation.

## 3. Phishing and Social Engineering:

### AI-Enhanced Phishing: 
Phishing campaigns are becoming more sophisticated by using AI to create convincing and personalized emails.

### Device Code Authentication Phishing: 
Russian threat actors are exploiting the Microsoft Device Code Authentication process to gain unauthorized access to accounts. The emails often spoof the U.S. Department of State. This attack method relies on the user entering a code on the Microsoft Device Code authentication page.
Beware of romance/ pig butchering scams articles around Valentines Day. By flipping the script and renaming pig butchering as romance baiting, Interpol suggests this could have a positive effect on the psychological nature of being targeted. "It's time to change our language to prioritize respect and empathy for the victims, and to hold fraudsters accountable for their crimes."

## 4. Malware and Exploitation Techniques:

### FINALDRAFT: 
A new malware family uses Microsoft's Graph API and leverages Outlook as a communication channel. It includes a custom loader, backdoor, and various submodules for post-exploitation activities, focusing on data exfiltration and process injection. "While investigating REF7707, Elastic Security Labs discovered a new family of previously unknown malware that leverages Outlook as a communication channel via the Microsoft Graph API." It is delivered using a renamed version of the Windows-signed debugger CDB.exe.

### PATHLOADER: 
Is frequently observed alongside FINALDRAFT

### LOLBins: 
Attackers are increasingly abusing legitimate operating system binaries (LOLBins) like certutil.exe and diskshadow.exe for malicious purposes such as downloading files and extracting registry hives. The CDB.exe debugger is also being abused to execute shellcode.

### Magecart Attacks: 
Attackers are injecting malicious code into checkout pages on Magento-based e-commerce sites by abusing the Google Tag Manager ad tool to steal payment card data.

## 5. Cloud Security Concerns:

### Data Loss Prevention in AI: 

Microsoft Purview DLP is designed to prevent the pasting of sensitive data or uploading of files containing sensitive content into Generative AI apps from supported browsers. The DLP policy can also adapt to insider risk levels, applying stronger restrictions to users that are categorized as ‘elevated risk’ and less stringent restrictions for those categorized as ‘low-risk’.

## 6. Incident Response and Mitigation:

- The Swedish Armed Forces (Försvarsmakten) are using the Signal app for open communication to prevent eavesdropping. "Försvarsmakten ska använda appen Signal för att försvåra avlyssning av samtal och meddelanden."
- General security advice to avoid phishing includes not clicking on links, using a password manager, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and keeping security software up to date.
- Network administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned in the "RedMike" article and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):

Several IOCs are listed in the Symantec report regarding the China-linked espionage tools used in ransomware attacks. Also included is a list of command and control domains used with the FINALDRAFT malware.

### Conclusion:

The cybersecurity landscape remains complex and dynamic. State-sponsored actors, ransomware groups, and sophisticated phishing campaigns present significant threats to organizations and individuals. A multi-layered security approach is necessary to mitigate these risks, including vulnerability management, robust authentication, network monitoring, threat intelligence sharing, and user awareness training.
