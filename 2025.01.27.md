## 1. Ransomware Activity

### Widespread Impact
Ransomware remains a significant threat, targeting organizations of all sizes and across diverse sectors.

### Prolific Groups
2024 saw 75 active ransomware groups, with an average of 45 active each month. The top 10 most active groups, based on leak site posts, were **RansomHub**, **LockBit**, **Play**, **Akira**, **Hunters**, **Medusa**, **Qilin**, **Black Basta**, **Cactus**, and **BianLian**.
> *"The ransomware landscape in 2024 continued to evolve at a rapid pace, outgrowing many of the trends we saw in 2023."* - Rapid7 Blog

### Financial Impact
Ransom payments remain substantial, with an average of **$479,237** and a median of **$200,000** in Q3 2024. An estimated **32% of victims pay ransoms**. Using these figures, the total ransomware revenue for 2024 is estimated to exceed **$380 million**, but likely understated.
> *"Even so, the total in 2024 could easily exceed $380 million in ransom paid."* - Rapid7 Blog

### Evolving Tactics
Groups like **Cl0p** are exploiting vulnerabilities in software, moving away from traditional encryption while still using leak sites for extortion.
> *"The Cl0p group recently disclosed exploiting a vulnerability in Cleo file transfer software, further illustrating how threat actors pivot between high-profile platform vulnerabilities with minimal downtime."* - Rapid7 Blog

There is also a rise in **double and triple extortion**, with threat actors demanding multiple payments for data release, encryption keys, and to prevent DDoS attacks.
> *"Rise of Double and Triple Extortion: Threat actors often demand multiple payments for data release, encryption keys, and in some cases, to prevent DDoS attacks or direct contact with partners and clients."* - Rapid7 Blog

### Notable Attacks
- **Stark Aerospace**: A US defense contractor was targeted by INC ransomware, with **4TB of data allegedly stolen**.
- **ICICI Bank (India)**: Allegedly targeted by BASHE ransomware, with threats to expose sensitive data (though the validity of the claim is questioned).
- **Change Healthcare**: The data breach affected **190 million people**, marking the largest healthcare breach in US history. Initially attacked by **ALPHV/BlackCat**, with data ultimately appearing on **RansomHub's** site.
> *"UnitedHealth now estimates that 190 million people were affected by the massive Change Healthcare data breach nearly a year ago."* - Malwarebytes

### LockBit
Despite law enforcement actions, **LockBit** remained active and a key player, with a person being charged as a developer for LockBit.
> *"LockBit remained active throughout 2024, even as it became the focus of significant law enforcement attention."* - Rapid7 Blog

## 2. Data Breaches & Vulnerabilities

### Telecom and Finance
- **TalkTalk (UK)**: Suffered a breach exposing millions of customer records.
- **Phemex (Singapore)**: Lost over **$69 million in digital assets** in a cyberattack.

### Service Providers
- **Conduent**: A US business services provider confirmed a cyber incident causing service disruptions.
- **Rostelecom (Russia)**: Investigating a data leak from a contractor, affecting customer information.

### Education
- **West Virginia’s Harrison County**: School district had to shut down its network after a cyberattack.

### Exploited Vulnerabilities
- **Ivanti Cloud Service Appliances**: Exploited through **four vulnerabilities** including administrative bypass, SQL injection, and remote code execution. These were used as **zero-day exploits**.
> *"Threat actors leveraged two distinct exploit chains to gain initial access, execute remote code, exfiltrate credentials, and implant webshells on victim networks."* - Check Point Threat Intelligence Report
- **SonicWall SMA1000 Appliances**: Vulnerable to a critical deserialization flaw allowing remote command execution, exploited as a zero-day.
- **Oracle**: January patch included fixes for **520 vulnerabilities**, many being remotely exploitable.

## 3. Phishing Techniques & Threats

### Microsoft Impersonation
Microsoft remains the most impersonated brand in phishing attacks. LinkedIn has reentered the top ten list of impersonated brands.

### Z-WASP Techniques
Threat actors are using **zero-width characters** and **HTML entities** (specifically, the "shy" HTML entity, ­) to obfuscate phishing URLs and bypass security filters. This older technique, combined with newer ones, is still effective.
> *"Inserting a zero-width character into a hyperlink can be used to bypass some URL security checks without any negative impact on the function of the link..."* - SANS Internet Storm Center

### "Shy Z-Wasp" Combination
Combining zero-width characters and the "shy" HTML entity is unusual but effective.
> *"Although this 'shy z-wasp' combination has most likely been used before, it is certainly unusual"* - SANS Internet Storm Center

### Recommendations for Users
- Drag-and-drop suspicious emails into the **Junk folder** to view the message without HTML formatting, exposing hidden characters and link destinations.

## 4. Data Privacy & Protection

### User Control
The **Malwarebytes Lock and Code** podcast emphasizes that **data privacy is about control over personal information**.

### Three Key Principles
1. **Limited Location Sharing**: Only share location when necessary, with trusted sources, and avoid constant background tracking.
2. **Accountability**: Users should abandon companies that don't respect data privacy.
3. **Avoid Data Deals**: Be aware that "free" services often come at the cost of personal data.
> *"That fast-food app offers more than just $4 off a combo meal, it creates a pipeline into your behavioral data."* - Malwarebytes

### Actions Following a Breach
- Check for specific vendor instructions.
- Change passwords, using strong and unique ones, and a password manager.
- Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), preferably with FIDO2 devices.
- Be wary of fake vendor communications.
- Avoid saving payment details on websites.
- Set up identity monitoring.

> *"You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it."* - Malwarebytes

### AI's Ability to Determine Location
The emergence of AI tools like **GeoSpy** highlights how location data can be derived from photos and used for surveillance.
> *"AI tool GeoSpy analyzes images and identifies locations in seconds."* - Malwarebytes

## 5. Threat Actor Behavior

- **North Korean IT Workers**: The FBI warns of North Korean IT workers posing as independent contractors to steal source code and extort employers.
- **Ransomware Affiliate Collaboration**: **Hellcat** and **Morpheus** ransomware affiliates deploy identical malicious payloads despite operating under different brands, indicating the use of a shared code base.
> *"Researchers have identified ransomware affiliates Hellcat and Morpheus deploying identical malicious payloads despite operating under different branding."* - Check Point Threat Intelligence Report

## 6. Industry Trends and Predictions

### Increased Transparency
More organizations are publicly disclosing breaches to maintain trust, though many attacks still remain hidden.
> *"More organizations are disclosing breaches to comply with emerging regulations as well as to maintain customer trust."* - Rapid7 Blog

### Symantec/Carbon Black
Broadcom is focused on innovation, using AI in endpoint security, data security for GenAI adopters, and enhanced data loss prevention, among other things, to create more accessible security solutions.
> *"Look for Symantec and Carbon Black to continue transforming cybersecurity in ways that benefit organizations of all sizes."* - Symantec Blog

## Recommendations

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement layered security measures, including robust patching, access control, and secure backups.
2. **Threat Intelligence**: Continuously monitor and analyze emerging threats, groups, and tactics to tailor defenses effectively.
3. **Attack Surface Management**: Maintain a continuous view of external footprints, prioritize fixes of known vulnerabilities, and scan for newly exposed services.
4. **Incident Response**: Develop clear incident response plans, and test them regularly.
5. **User Education**: Train users to recognize phishing techniques, especially those using hidden characters, and to practice good data privacy habits.
6. **Vendor Security**: Enforce robust security protocols for third-party collaborations, and outsourced IT services.
7. **Emphasize Control**: Empower users to control their personal data, and hold companies accountable for data privacy.
