# Emerging Risks and Mitigation - 2025.02.18

## Executive Summary

This briefing covers a range of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities identified in recent reports. Key themes include: sophisticated malware distribution techniques (e.g., leveraging legitimate software, process injection, traffic distribution systems), the importance of threat actor attribution, the growing risk of AI/ML model serialization attacks, the need for responsible data decommissioning, supply chain risks, and the persistent threat posed by keyloggers and cryptominers.

## Key Themes and Findings

### Sophisticated Malware Distribution Techniques
- Fake Updates and Traffic Distribution: Threat actors like TA569 and TA2727 use fake update lures to distribute malware. TA2726 acts as a traffic distribution service (TDS) redirecting users to malicious payloads, including Lumma Stealer, DeerStealer, FrigidStealer, and Marcher. "Proofpoint is reassessing existing activity related to TA569 and previous reporting, and assesses with high confidence TA2726 acts as a traffic distribution service (TDS) for TA569 and TA2727."
- Leveraging Legitimate Software: Earth Preta (Mustang Panda) utilizes the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector (MAVInject.exe) and Setup Factory to evade detection and establish persistence. "Earth Preta utilizes Setup Factory, an installer builder for Windows software, to drop and execute the payload; this enables them to evade detection and maintain persistence in compromised systems."
- Process Injection: Snake Keylogger uses process hollowing to inject malicious code into a legitimate .NET process (RegSvcs.exe), making it harder to detect. "After the execution of ageless.exe, the malware injects its malicious payload into a legitimate .NET process...using a technique known as process hollowing, which allows the malware to execute its code within a trusted process to evade detection."
- Trojanized Installers: The StaryDobry campaign distributes the XMRig cryptominer through trojanized versions of popular games downloaded from torrent sites. "Trojanized versions of popular games—such as BeamNG.drive, Garry’s Mod, Dyson Sphere Program, Universe Sandbox, and Plutocracy—were designed to launch a sophisticated infection chain, ultimately deploying a miner implant."

### Threat Actor Attribution
- Proofpoint is actively working on attributing malicious activity. The report provides details on TA569, TA2726, and TA2727, including their tactics, infrastructure, and motivations. They note, "Proofpoint is able to identify TA2726 activity distinctly from other threat actors based on the actor’s infrastructure including the use of Keitaro and consistent domain patterns and IP addresses."
- Trend Micro attributes a sophisticated attack chain leveraging MAVInject to Earth Preta (Mustang Panda), based on similar TTPs, code similarities, and shared infrastructure. "For attribution, we believe this variant is more likely associated with Earth Preta. It was distributed using similar TTPs (spear-phishing) and works like the earlier variant mentioned in our previous entry on Earth Preta."
- Kaspersky identifies a previously unknown actor behind the StaryDobry campaign. "Our telemetry detected the attack, which lasted for a month and affected individuals and businesses by distributing the XMRig cryptominer. This previously unidentified actor is targeting users worldwide…"
- AI/ML Model Serialization Attacks
- ModelScan is a tool designed to protect against model serialization attacks, where malicious code is added to AI/ML models during the saving (serialization) process. "A Model Serialization Attack is where malicious code is added to the contents of a model during serialization(saving) before distribution — a modern version of the Trojan Horse."
- PyTorch is implementing safety updates by warning users about the risks of using torch.load() without setting weights_only to True, highlighting the potential for arbitrary code execution during unpickling. "WARNING: torch.load() unless weights_only parameter is set to True, uses pickle module implicitly, which is known to be insecure...Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode..."
- Such attacks can lead to credential theft, data theft, data poisoning, and model poisoning. "A Model Serialization Attack can be used to execute: Credential Theft...Data Theft...Data Poisoning...Model Poisoning."
- Recommendations include scanning pre-trained models before loading, scanning models after training, and scanning models before deployment.

### Data Security and Decommissioning
- The discovery of hard drives containing sensitive medical data in a flea market highlights the critical importance of secure data decommissioning practices. "Somebody bought a batch of 15 GB hard drives from a flea market, and during a routine check of the contents they found medical data about hundreds of patients."
- The incident emphasizes the need for professional data erasure with certification or physical destruction (shredding) when disposing of storage media containing sensitive information. "Under Dutch law, storage media with medical data must be professionally erased with certification. The normal procedure is to have them destroyed by a professional company…"
- Encryption is a crucial measure, but even then, responsible decommissioning is required.
- Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk Management
- Organizations deploying AI/ML heavily rely on external components (foundation models, training data, hardware), introducing unique risks. "Each of these introduces unique risks. A compromised third-party model could have backdoors or biases baked in that are extremely difficult to detect."
- "Shadow AI" (unauthorized use of AI tools) poses major risks because these systems may not meet security and compliance requirements. "Shadow AI — the unauthorized use of AI tools — poses major risks, since these systems may not meet security and compliance requirements."
- AI systems are not static and require continuous monitoring and adaptation due to data drift, new attack vectors, evolving regulations, and changing user behavior. "They drift as input distributions change, new attack vectors are discovered, regulations evolve, and user behavior adapts to new market trends...You need continuous adaptation."

### Persistent Keylogger and Cryptominer Threats
- Snake Keylogger remains a significant threat, with FortiGuard Labs detecting a new variant responsible for over 280 million blocked infection attempts. This highlights the ongoing need for advanced detection mechanisms. The FortiSandbox's detection capabilities include identifying process injection, access to browser credentials, and network traffic used for exfiltration.
- The StaryDobry campaign demonstrates how cryptominers are distributed through deceptive means (trojanized installers) to exploit users' resources.

## Recommendations

### Enhance Monitoring: 
Focus on identifying unusual activity in legitimate processes and executable files.

### Implement AI/ML Model Scanning: 
Use tools like ModelScan to detect and prevent model serialization attacks.

### Strengthen Data Decommissioning Practices: 
Ensure all sensitive data is securely erased or physically destroyed when storage media is retired.

### Improve Third-Party Risk Management: 
Implement thorough assessments, clear agreements, and ongoing monitoring of all third-party components used in AI/ML deployments.

### Control Shadow IT: 
Enforce policies and provide approved tools to prevent unauthorized use of AI systems.

### Prioritize Security Awareness Training: 
Educate users about phishing, fake updates, and the risks of downloading software from untrusted sources. "User training is one of the most important ways to prevent exploitation."

### Harden MLOps Infrastructure: 
Establish robust tools and processes for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining AI systems reliably over time.

### Patch Management: 
Keep systems and software up to date to address known vulnerabilities.

### Employ Multi-Layered Security: 
Use a combination of antivirus, intrusion detection/prevention systems, sandboxing, and other security tools to provide comprehensive protection.

### Utilize Threat Intelligence: 
Stay informed about the latest threats and TTPs to proactively defend against attacks.
