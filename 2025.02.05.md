# Cybersecurity Landscape - 2025.02.05

## Executive Summary:

This briefing highlights current trends, threats, and solutions in the cybersecurity landscape, as reported by AWS, Cloudflare, SANS Internet Storm Center, Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, and ReversingLabs as of early February 2025. Key takeaways include: evolving phishing techniques, nation-state actors in space, the limitations of sandboxes for malware detection, targeting of web shops, mobile malware (specifically crypto stealers), and the continued relevance of social engineering in "Nigerian" scams. AWS is taking steps to improve its own and its users security through changes to default behaviour in 2025.

## Key Themes and Ideas:

## 1. Evolving Phishing Techniques & Scams:

### Domain Name Tricks: 
Attackers are using "com-" prefixes in domain names (e.g., "com-sunpass.top") to mimic legitimate websites and trick users into thinking they are accessing a trusted resource. "An unsuspecting user may consider this a valid sunpass.com address." The SANS Internet Storm Center recommends reviewing DNS logs for lookups to these types of domains.

### "Nigerian" Scams Adapt: 
These scams continue to evolve, using current events and trends as bait. Themes include wealthy benefactors (often claiming to be terminally ill), compensation offers, lottery wins, and fake business investment opportunities. "The themes of these phishing emails evolved over time, with cybercriminals leveraging contemporary events and popular trends to pique the interest of their targets." Scammers rely heavily on social engineering to build trust over extended periods. They target not only individuals, but also are now approaching business with claims of investment opportunities.

### Recruiting Scam: 
Sophisticated LinkedIn recruiting scams are being used by threat actors (potentially state-sponsored, such as the Lazarus Group) to deliver malware and compromise organizations. The attackers provide a "minimum viable product" (MVP) of a project, including a document that requires executing the demo. The trap relies on the victim running malicious code disguised within seemingly harmless files.

## 2. Nation-State Activity in Space:

### Space as a New Battleground: 
Nation-states are militarizing space and viewing it as a contested domain with vast resources.

### Cyberattacks on Satellites: 
Satellites are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, and this trend is expected to intensify. Espionage, destructive attacks, supply chain compromise, and signal hijacking. The focus is extending beyond Earth's orbit to deeper space.

### Importance of Cybersecurity: 
Space-related organizations must prioritize cybersecurity to protect their operations and assets. Researchers are advancing frameworks like SPARTA to stay ahead of evolving tactics.
Stages of the Space Race Initial stages of the space race centre on Earths orbit, followed by efforts to colonize the Moon, mine asteroids, and establish a presence on habitable worlds beyond Earth. As ambitions grow, so will efforts to outmaneuver rival nations.

## 3. Limitations of Traditional Sandboxes:

### Overwhelmed by Volume & Complexity: 
Traditional sandboxes struggle with the sheer volume and complexity of files entering enterprise networks daily. "Today’s enterprise organizations are dealing with tens of thousands of files, if not more, entering their network each day that need to be analyzed." The increased size (often exceeding 500MB) and multilayered nature of files pose a significant challenge.

### "Fail Open" Issues: 
Sandboxes may issue "malware not found" results when they cannot analyze a file due to limitations, allowing potentially malicious files to pass through.

### Evasion Techniques: 
Malware developers are using increasingly sophisticated techniques, such as time delays, user-activity checks, and code obfuscation, to evade sandbox detection.

### Alternative Approaches: 
Static binary analysis, as offered by ReversingLabs, can analyze files quickly without executing them, overcoming size and format limitations. This approach can reduce sandbox needs by approximately 90%. "By starting with this advanced static analysis process, organizations can analyze and definitively classify more files immediately, drastically reducing what needs to be sent to a sandbox."

## 4. Threats to Online Web Shops (eCommerce):

### Targeting of eCommerce Platforms: 
Cybercriminals are actively targeting vulnerabilities in popular platforms like Shopify, Wix, and Magento to insert skimmers and gain access to databases.

### Data Breaches: 
Large datasets containing millions of customer records are being leaked from breached Shopify stores.

### Skimmers & Malware: 
Magento-based web shops have been found with skimmers injecting code to steal credit card information and infecting visitors with malware like SocGholish.

## 5. Mobile Malware & Crypto Stealers:

### SparkCat Malware: 
A cross-platform (Android and iOS) crypto stealer, dubbed "SparkCat," has been discovered in official app marketplaces (Google Play and App Store). "Our analysis of the malicious Rust code inside the iOS frameworks revealed client code for communicating with the “rust” server and server-side encryption components. This suggests that the attackers’ servers likely also use Rust for protocol handling."

### Modus Operandi: 
The malware uses a malicious SDK ("Spark") that downloads a configuration file from a remote URL (GitLab) and decrypts it. It then targets images in the user's gallery, searching for recovery phrases ("mnemonics") for cryptocurrency wallets using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). It uses sophisticated techniques, including the Rust programming language (rare in mobile malware), obfuscation, and C2 domains mimicking legitimate services.

## 6. AWS Security Initiatives

Amazon Redshift is taking a significant step forward in strengthening the default security posture of our customers’ data warehouses by changing default behaviour in 2025
AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is reducing dependency on a single Region, STS launched AWS STS Regional endpoints in February 2015
AWS Network Firewall is a managed, stateful network firewall and intrusion protection service that you can use to implement firewall rules for fine grained control over your network traffic.

## 7. Cloudflare's Public Sector Security

Cloudflare are pursuing FedRAMP High, IRAP, and ENS as part of Cloudflare for Government, to ensure governments and regulated industries have industry standard tools for ensuring their uptime, reliability and performance

## 8. Singapore Multi-Tier Cloud Security Standard Renewal

AWS was the first cloud service provider (CSP) to attain MTCS Level 3 certification for Singapore in 2014. It has increased in scope from 145 to 184 services.
MTCS Level 3 certification is a testament to this commitment, enabling AWS customers in Singapore and around the world to use AWS services with confidence for their most sensitive and critical workloads.

## Recommendations:

### Enhanced Domain Monitoring: 
Implement robust monitoring of newly registered domains and DNS lookups, paying close attention to "com-" prefixes and other similar patterns.

### User Education: 
Raise awareness among users about the evolving tactics used in phishing and social engineering attacks, particularly those related to recruiting scams.

### Advanced Malware Analysis: 
Adopt advanced malware analysis techniques, such as static binary analysis, to complement traditional sandboxes and improve detection rates.

### eCommerce Security: 
Implement strong security measures for online web shops, including regular vulnerability scans, code reviews, and proactive monitoring for skimmers and malware.

### Mobile Device Security: 
Educate users about the risks of mobile malware and encourage them to download apps only from trusted sources and to be cautious about granting permissions.

### Strengthen Supply Chain Security: 
Given the focus on compromising software supply chains and dependencies, implement rigorous security measures to verify the integrity of software components and third-party libraries.
