# Analysis of Recent Security & Technology Trends (February 4, 2025)

## Executive Summary:

This briefing document synthesizes information from a variety of sources focusing on emerging cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and trends observed in early 2025. Key areas of concern include supply chain attacks exploiting abandoned infrastructure, ongoing nation-state cyber activity, the rise of macOS infostealers, vulnerabilities in widely-used software, and the need for robust OT security. Additionally, the use of AI by both threat actors and defenders is highlighted as an evolving dynamic.

## I. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Exploiting Abandoned Infrastructure

### Theme: 
A significant and widespread vulnerability stems from the abandonment of cloud infrastructure, particularly Amazon S3 buckets. Threat actors are re-registering these buckets to deliver malicious content to unsuspecting users.

### WatchTowr Research: 
Researchers at watchTowr demonstrated the potential for massive supply chain attacks by registering abandoned S3 buckets and logging the requests they received. Over 8 million requests were observed in a two month period for various file types:
"Software updates, pre-compiled (unsigned!) Windows, Linux and macOS binaries, virtual machine images (?!), JavaScript files, CloudFormation templates, SSLVPN server configurations, and more."
This revealed that critical infrastructure, including government, military, Fortune companies, and financial institutions were requesting files from abandoned buckets.
The researchers were able to register abandoned S3 buckets simply by typing the name into the input box.

### Potential Attacks: 
This infrastructure could be exploited to deliver:
Malicious software updates.
Backdoored virtual machine images.
Compromised CloudFormation templates giving access to AWS environments.
Ransomware-infected binaries.
Malicious Javascript to compromise web browsers.

### Specific Examples:
JavaScript from abandoned buckets referenced by <script src=""> tags, allowing for potential website compromise, “...we saw 2000 or so requests for this JavaScript file alone.”
Patches and updates for security products referenced on cisa.gov from old and abandoned S3 buckets.
Linux antivirus agent configurations being pulled from abandoned buckets, although apt and yum package management systems mitigate some risk.

### SSLVPN configuration templates being fetched from untrusted sources: 
“is it a good idea to fetch your CloudFormation templates from untrusted locations, or abandoned infrastructure? No, stop it."
Virtual machine images retrieved by Vagrant, highlighting “...systems pulling entire virtual machine images out of abandoned S3 buckets”.
Executable binaries being pulled from random locations, including “production card processing servers for a major global payment card processor.”
Archived release binaries for tools like emscripten being pulled from abandoned buckets, even being referenced in the Android toolchain.

### Root Cause: 
The ease of acquiring internet infrastructure (S3 buckets, domains) has created a mindset that it's "easy come, easy go" resulting in a lack of maintenance and management of these resources. "This mindset lulls us in and persuades us that Internet infrastructure is ‘easy come, easy go’."

### Remediation Complexity: 
Transferring ownership back to original owners can be challenging, involving identifying the correct individuals or departments within an organization. “...we have to somehow determine that we are handing these S3 buckets to the correct person, correct department - and not a bad actor that may even exist in the same organization."

## II. Nation-State Cyber Espionage & Exploitation

### Theme: 
The Russo-Ukrainian conflict continues to fuel cyber espionage and attacks. Russian cybercrime groups are actively exploiting vulnerabilities targeting Ukrainian organizations.

### CVE-2025-0411: 
A zero-day vulnerability in 7-Zip (CVE-2025-0411) was actively exploited in a SmokeLoader malware campaign, allowing for the bypassing of Windows Mark-of-the-Web protections.
Attackers used double archiving and homoglyph attacks (spoofing document extensions) to trick users into executing malicious files.
Spear-phishing campaigns were used to deliver malicious .url files pointing to attacker-controlled servers.
These servers then delivered ZIP archives with executables disguised as PDF documents, ultimately loading the SmokeLoader malware and compromising systems.
This is believed to be a cyberespionage campaign against Ukrainian government and civilian organizations.
Trend Micro recommends that organizations update to 7-Zip version 24.09 or later, implement strong email security measures, and conduct employee training on phishing and homoglyph attacks.

### Other Countries Impacted: 
There are listings of Trend Micro partners in many countries across Europe and Asia which would likely indicate that they may have been targeted by this and other malware attacks. “Europe: België (Belgium), Česká Republika, Danmark, Deutschland, Österreich Schweiz, España, France, Ireland, Italia, Nederland, Norge (Norway), Polska (Poland), Suomi (Finland), Sverige (Sweden), Türkiye (Turkey), United Kingdom Asia & Pacific: Australia, Центральная Азия (Central Asia), Hong Kong (English), 香港 (中文) (Hong Kong), भारत गणराज्य (India), Indonesia, 日本 (Japan), 대한민국 (South Korea), Malaysia, Монголия (Mongolia) and рузия (Georgia), New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, 台灣 (Taiwan), ประเทศไทย (Thailand), Việt Nam”

## III. The Growing Threat of macOS Infostealers

### Theme: 
There is a growing trend of macOS infostealers targeting multiple regions and industries.

### Prevalent Stealers: 
Three macOS infostealers have been identified as particularly prevalent:

### Atomic Stealer: 
Delivered via malvertising, steals notes, documents, browser data, crypto wallets, and instant messaging data. It uses Mach-O binaries, Python scripts, or code written in C++.

### Poseidon Stealer: 
Distributed through Google Ads, malicious spam, and Trojanized installers, which execute encoded AppleScript files and use MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service).

### Cthulhu Stealer: 
No details on delivery are provided.

### Impact: 
These threats highlight the expanding attack surface of macOS systems and the need for robust security solutions.

### Indicators of Compromise: 
SHA256 hashes and C2 server IP addresses are provided for each stealer.

## IV. Vulnerabilities and Software Security

### authentik Software Vulnerability: 
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2024-11623) was discovered in authentik software, impacting all versions prior to 2024.10.4.

### Need for Secure by Design and Default: 
The need for software to be secure by design and default is reinforced, emphasizing that application security should not be an "either/or proposition." CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) also advocates for these approaches.

### Malware Bypassing Root Check: 
Malware has been found that checks for root privileges, and exits if they aren't found. This is a malware that overwrites legitimate binaries, such as ls, netstat, and crond, infecting them. It also infects the SSH daemon, communicating with a remote C2 server to issue commands, such as to retrieve basic system information, list services, enumerate users, and execute terminal commands.
AI Exaggeration and Omissions AI used for code analysis may exaggerate or omit information, so humans need to check AI output carefully and provide additional prompts for accuracy.

## V. Operational Technology (OT) Security

### NIST SP 800-82r3: 
This document provides a framework for securing industrial control systems (ICS) and OT environments. It's relevant to a wide range of industries including energy, manufacturing, transportation, water, chemical processing, and healthcare.

### Key Control Families: 
The guide outlines 19 control families including Access Control, Awareness and Training, Incident Response and System and Information Integrity, among others.

### Dragos and NP-View: 
Solutions from these vendors help organizations implement NIST SP 800-82r3 guidelines, through:
- Asset visibility
- Vulnerability management

### Importance: 
The need for robust OT security is critical due to increasing cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure.

### Guidance on Device Security: 
A joint effort document by NCSC, ASD, CISA, CSE, FBI, and NCSC-NZ provides guidance on securing edge devices including: Logging (process creation/termination, dynamic loading, file system changes, DNS queries), network time protocol (NTP) usage, GUID identification, local storage management, near real time remote logging, volatile data collection, and non-volatile data collection.

## VI. AI in Security and Cybercrime

### AI Agents for Ransom: 
There is concern that new AI agents could be used to hold people for ransom in 2025.

### AI for Obfuscation: 
LLMs are being used to obfuscate malicious Javascript. AI for Code analysis AI used for code analysis may exaggerate or omit information.

### AI-Powered Insights: 
Cloudflare Radar is utilizing AI to expand and better track the latest internet trends.

## VII. Data Breaches and Privacy

### Valley News Live Breach: 
A data breach at Valley News Live exposed over one million job seekers' resumes, potentially leading to financial fraud, identity theft, and privacy issues.

### Risks of Stolen Resumes: 
Phishers can use information in resumes to create convincing social engineering attacks, including impersonating victims, committing SIM swaps, and creating fraudulent accounts.

### Conclusion:

The security landscape in early 2025 is characterized by complex threats that exploit weaknesses in both technology and human behavior. The findings highlight the need for organizations to address:

- The vulnerabilities created by abandoned cloud infrastructure and orphaned assets.
- The continuous threat of nation-state cyber activity and sophisticated exploitation techniques.
