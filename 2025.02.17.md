# Cybersecurity Threat Briefing: 2025.02.17

## Executive Summary:

This briefing summarizes key cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and trends reported in mid-February 2025 by Check Point Research, Malwarebytes Labs, Emsisoft, Symantec (Broadcom), Cloudflare, SANS Internet Storm Center, and The Shadowserver Foundation. The reports highlight the ongoing prevalence of ransomware attacks targeting various sectors, the exploitation of legitimate system tools (LOLBins) by threat actors, and the importance of adaptive protection measures. Additionally, there's a growing focus on protecting network edge devices, supporting vulnerable communities against cyberattacks, and the increasing use of cybercrime capabilities by state-linked entities. Proactive monitoring, patching, and a multi-layered security approach are emphasized as critical for mitigating these risks.

## Key Themes and Findings:

### Ransomware Attacks Continue to Surge:
- Several sources highlight the continued prevalence and impact of ransomware attacks across diverse industries and geographies. Check Point Research reports multiple breaches, including those targeting SimonMed Imaging, Lee Enterprises, the University of Notre Dame Australia, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Empire Group, Unimicron Technology, and Papua New Guinea's Internal Revenue Commission.
- Specific ransomware groups mentioned include Medusa, Fog, and Lynx. The Medusa group demanded a $1 million ransom in Bitcoin after exfiltrating 212 GB of data from SimonMed Imaging, exposing private information of over 132,000 individuals.
- Malwarebytes Labs highlights a report indicating that "Ransomware groups were faster, stealthier, and more active than ever in 2024."
- Qlik Sense is specifically listed as a victim of the Cactus ransomware group.

### Living Off the Land (LOLBins) Attacks are a Growing Threat:
- Emsisoft and Symantec (Broadcom) emphasize the increasing use of LOLBins (Living Off the Land Binaries) by attackers. LOLBins are legitimate system executables leveraged for malicious purposes.
- Emsisoft defines LOLBins as "essentially native system executables found within operating systems, primarily Windows but also macOS and Linux, that can be leveraged for malicious purposes."
- Symantec (Broadcom) notes that "Nearly half of recent ransomware attacks involved LOTL techniques. In fact, out of the 10 tools most commonly used in ransomware attacks, six were legitimate software."

## Examples of commonly abused LOLBins include:
### Windows: 
powershell.exe, cmd.exe, regsvr32.exe, wmic.exe, certutil.exe, bitsadmin.exe, mshta.exe, rundll32.exe, taskschd.exe, csc.exe, psexec.exe, CertReq.exe.

### macOS/Linux: curl, wget, ssh, tar, dd, awk, sed.
- Emsisoft highlights the difficulty in detecting LOLBin usage due to their legitimate presence, making it challenging to distinguish normal activity from malicious intent.
- Symantec (Broadcom) introduces Adaptive Protection for on-premise environments as a solution to block unauthorized use of system functions and tools: "One way to stop LOTL attacks and other threats is to proactively block unauthorized and anomalous use of system functions and toolsâ€“use that falls outside the standard ways an organization uses those tools."

### Vulnerability Exploitation and Patching:
- Check Point Research reports on Microsoft's February 2025 Patch Tuesday, which addresses 67 vulnerabilities, including three critical RCE risks. Two vulnerabilities, a heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) and an elevation of privilege (EoP) flaw in the Windows Storage service, have been observed being exploited in the wild.
- An authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-0108) in Palo Alto's next-generation firewalls is under active exploitation. "The vulnerability exists due to discrepancies in how Nginx and Apache handle URL requests, which could compromise system integrity and confidentiality."
- Adobe released patches addressing CVE-2025-24434, a critical improper authorization vulnerability affecting Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source.
- Shadowserver highlights numerous CVEs being actively scanned for and exploited, including those affecting Jenkins, Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs, ConnectWise ScreenConnect, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, Qlik Sense, VMware vCenter and ESXi, Progress MOVEit Transfer, GeoServer, SolarWinds Help Desk, Fortinet FortiOS and FortiManager, and Cleo Harmony/VLTrader/LexiCom.

### Protecting Network Edge Devices:
- SANS Internet Storm Center emphasizes the importance of securing network edge devices.

### Key recommendations include:
- Limiting access to admin functions (via LAN interface only).
- Changing default credentials and using MFA.
- Establishing a monthly "Router Update Day."
- Considering open-source solutions like OpenWRT, PFSense, or OPNSense.
- Creating automated configuration backups.
- Treating edge devices as endpoints and installing endpoint protection software.

### Cybersecurity Capacity Building and Support for Vulnerable Communities:
- Cloudflare and The Shadowserver Foundation highlight efforts to support civil society organizations and vulnerable communities against cyberattacks.
- Cloudflare's partnership with the CyberPeace Institute focuses on providing email security and threat intelligence to NGOs. "Through our unique partnership, the CyberPeace Institute onboards its network of NGOs with Cloudflare Email Security, serving as a central hub to aggregate real-time data on email threats."
- The CyberPeace Tracer resource enables researchers, civil society, governments, and other organizations to understand threats and data-driven insights about the cyber threat landscape.
- The Shadowserver Foundation's Global Cybersecurity Capacity Building efforts aim to provide National CSIRTs, government agencies, network operators and system defenders in a target country or region with the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools to improve threat detection; enable effective incident response; and strengthen cyber resilience.
- These include efforts in Africa, the Indo-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Gulf Region of the Middle East.

### Cybercrime and State-Linked Entities:
- Check Point Research notes that Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) addresses the escalation of financially motivated cybercrime, revealing its impact on national security. It describes how state-linked entities tap into cybercrime capabilities for their goals, exemplified in the case of Russian military intelligence leveraging tools from cybercrime communities.
- The Shadowserver Foundation details assistance provided to Law Enforcement in disruption operations against various cybercrime activities, including botnets controlled by the Russian GRU and phishing-as-a-service platforms.

## Recommendations:

### Prioritize Patching: 
Immediately apply security patches for critical vulnerabilities identified in Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Adobe, and other software.

### Strengthen Endpoint Security: 
Implement robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and prevent malware, including LOLBin attacks.

### Implement Adaptive Protection: 
Consider deploying adaptive protection measures to block unauthorized use of system tools, especially in on-premise environments.

### Enhance Network Security: 
Follow best practices for securing network edge devices, including limiting access, changing credentials, using MFA, and implementing a regular update schedule.

### Monitor Threat Intelligence: 
Stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities by monitoring threat intelligence feeds from reputable sources like Check Point Research, Malwarebytes Labs, Emsisoft, The Shadowserver Foundation, and Cloudflare.

### Promote User Awareness: 
Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training for employees to educate them about phishing scams and other social engineering attacks.

### Support Cybersecurity Capacity Building: 
Contribute to initiatives that strengthen cybersecurity defenses for civil society organizations and vulnerable communities.
