# Cybersecurity Threat Briefing: Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defenses - 2025.02.06

## Executive Summary

This briefing covers a range of cybersecurity topics from cloud security compliance and attack surface management to specific threats like code injection attacks, malicious AI models, and scams exploiting disruptions in postal services. Additionally, it highlights advancements and partnerships in cybersecurity solutions, particularly in the realm of secure SD-branch with 5G and anti-debugging techniques used in malware. Key themes include the growing sophistication of attacks, the importance of proactive security measures, and the collaborative efforts within the cybersecurity industry to combat evolving threats.

## 1. Cloud Security and Compliance

### FINMA Compliance (AWS): 
AWS has achieved a Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) Type II attestation report, covering 179 services. This signifies that AWS's control environment is appropriately designed and effective in adhering to FINMA requirements for regulated financial services customers in Switzerland.
"An independent third-party audit firm issued the report to assure customers that the AWS control environment is appropriately designed and operating effectively to support adherence with FINMA requirements."

### GCP Data Destruction via Cloud Build: 
Cloud Build, a GCP CI/CD service, presents a potential threat vector. Attackers can leverage the cloudbuild.builds.create permission to execute malicious gcloud CLI commands, potentially leading to data destruction. The report recommends implementing anomaly detection for Cloud Build service accounts and applying the principle of least privilege.
"A threat actor with just the ability to submit and run a Cloud Build job (in other words, who has the cloudbuild.builds.create permission) can execute any gcloud GCP command line interface (CLI) command that the Cloud Build SA has the permissions to perform."

## 2. Attack Surface Management (ASM)

### Enhancing ASM for MSPs/MSSPs: 
The Rapid7 blog emphasizes the necessity for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to enhance their Attack Surface Management (ASM) capabilities. ASM powered risk assessments can help MSPs/MSSPs "confidently structure pricing, demonstrating their value as proactive and reliable partners." Differentiating services in a crowded market through advanced vulnerability detection and prioritized remediation efforts is key.
"Without advanced tools to uncover vulnerabilities or prioritize remediation efforts, security offerings may appear standardized, making it harder to justify premium pricing."

## 3. Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities

### ASP.NET Code Injection: 
Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed attacks leveraging publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys for ViewState code injection, delivering the Godzilla post-exploitation framework. Over 3,000 publicly disclosed keys have been identified. Microsoft recommends against copying keys from public sources and encourages regular key rotation.
"Microsoft has since identified over 3,000 publicly disclosed keys that could be used for these types of attacks, which are called ViewState code injection attacks."

### Malicious AI Models: 
RL researchers discovered malicious ML models on the Hugging Face platform using a novel attack technique called "nullifAI." This involves evading security scanning mechanisms by inserting malicious code within Pickle files, which can execute arbitrary commands. RL's Spectra Assure product is designed to detect such suspicious activities.
"During RL research efforts, the team came upon two Hugging Face models containing malicious code that were not flagged as “unsafe” by Hugging Face’s security scanning mechanisms. RL has named this technique “nullif AI ,” because it involves evading existing protections in the AI community for an ML model."

### Exploiting USPS Suspension: 
Malwarebytes highlights the potential for scams exploiting confusion surrounding a brief USPS suspension of inbound packages from China and Hong Kong.

## 4. Cybersecurity Solutions and Partnerships

### Palo Alto Networks Partner Awards: 
Palo Alto Networks recognized top-performing partners across various categories, including Cortex Partners, Distributors, Systems Integrators, and Managed Security Service Providers. AWS was named the EMEA LATAM Cloud Service Provider of the Year. Several partners are recognized for platformization and innovation in specific regions. Collaboration with IBM led to new joint offerings leveraging AI automation and a joint Cyber Range.

### Fortinet Secure SD-Branch with 5G: 
Fortinet promotes its Secure SD-Branch solution, combining next-generation security with 5G connectivity. The FortiGate 50G Next-Generation Firewall offers high performance, energy efficiency, and protection. The solution aims to improve cyberthreat defenses, connectivity reliability, and reduce energy consumption.
"Fortinet Secure SD-Branch extends the benefits of secure SD-WAN by integrating advanced networking and security capabilities into a single, cohesive platform."

## 5. Malware Analysis and Anti-Debugging Techniques

### Multi-Layer Anti-Debugging: 
A SANS ISC diary analyzes a malicious Python script employing various anti-debugging techniques, including polymorphic self-mutation, debugger detection via sys.gettrace, memory tampering detection, API hooking detection, and hardware breakpoint detection. The purpose of these functions is to annoy the malware analysts or crashing their system.
"The file just contains only anti-debugging stuff and not real malware. I suspect the file to be a proof-of-concept."

## 6. Social Engineering and Phishing

### Fake Cisco Installer: 
Malwarebytes reports on a campaign where a university site was cloned to evade ad detection, distributing a fake Cisco installer containing the NetSupport RAT. The malicious ad appeared in Google searches and redirected victims to a lookalike Cisco site.
"The malicious ad comes up from a Google search for the keywords “ cisco annyconnect “. The ad displays a URL that looks somewhat convincing for the domain anyconnect-secure-client[.]com ."

## Recommendations

### Prioritize ASM: 
MSPs and MSSPs should invest in robust Attack Surface Management tools to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

### Implement Least Privilege: 
Apply the principle of least privilege to cloud service accounts, limiting their permissions to only what is necessary for their function.

### Monitor Cloud Build: 
Implement anomaly detection for Cloud Build service accounts to identify unusual activities.

### Rotate ASP.NET Keys: 
Regularly rotate ASP.NET machine keys and avoid copying keys from publicly available sources.

### Secure ML Models: 
Organizations using ML models should implement thorough security scanning and validation processes to prevent the use of malicious models.

### Educate Users: 
Educate users about the latest scams and social engineering tactics, emphasizing the importance of verifying the legitimacy of websites and downloads, especially from search ad results.

### Strengthen Defenses: 
Strengthen defenses against cyber threats with the most up-to-date security services.
This briefing provides a snapshot of the current cybersecurity landscape, highlighting the challenges organizations face and the solutions available to mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring, adaptation, and collaboration are essential to staying ahead of evolving threats.
