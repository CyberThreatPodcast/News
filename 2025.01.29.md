# Cybersecurity Landscape Review - January 29, 2025

## Executive Summary:

This document provides an overview of the current cybersecurity landscape based on a variety of sources, including blog posts, research articles, and security advisories. Key themes include the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, the expanding attack surface due to new technologies and connected devices (IoMT, IIoT), the importance of proactive security measures like attack surface management (ASM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR), and the need to adapt to evolving threats, including those related to AI and supply chains. The documents highlight the necessity for constant vigilance, robust security practices, and continuous improvement to stay ahead of malicious actors.

### Key Themes and Ideas:

### 1. Evolving Attack Techniques and Sophistication

**Multi-Technology Attacks:** Attackers are combining different technologies (e.g., PowerShell, Python) to evade detection and deploy malicious code. The SANS ISC article describes a sophisticated attack where PowerShell downloads a fake document and a Python environment, then executes a heavily obfuscated InfoStealer. The Python code uses "reversed strings, compressed and Base64-encode" and this process has been "implemented approximately 30(!) times" to make analysis very difficult.

**Evasion and Bypass Techniques:** Attackers are actively looking for ways to bypass security rules. Elastic is explicitly creating a bounty program around this: "Elastic is now offering a unique opportunity for researchers to test our detection rules (SIEM) and endpoint rules (EDR), helping to identify gaps, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement." The program focuses on areas like "privilege evasion" and "creative bypasses of detection rules for specific techniques such as process injection, credential dumping...".

**Exploitation of Legitimate Tools:** Attackers are increasingly abusing legitimate tools (e.g., certutil, sqlcmd.exe) for malicious purposes like payload delivery, data exfiltration and database manipulation. The CL-STA-0048 report details how attackers use certutil to download PlugX components and sqlcmd.exe for exfiltrating data from SQL servers.
Use of DLL Sideloading: Attackers use DLL sideloading to execute malicious code via vulnerable, legitimate binaries, as detailed in the CL-STA-0048 report: "The threat actor then used the DLL sideloading technique and exploited vulnerable legitimate binaries ( Acrobat.exe ) to initiate the PlugX loader Acrobat.dll."

**Data Exfiltration via DNS:** The CL-STA-0048 report describes an attack using a novel method: "The scripts exfiltrated command outputs by formatting each line as a string constructed of a series of subdomains and sending ping requests to these subdomains...Each ping command triggered a DNS request, transmitting the exfiltrated data to the attackers via DNS."

### 2. Expanding Attack Surface

IoMT (Internet of Medical Things): The proliferation of IoMT devices is creating new opportunities for malicious actors. The Palo Alto Networks article notes, "It makes sense, then, that the global value of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare is expected to reach $332.67 billion by 2027." These devices, while beneficial, add a new layer of complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things): Kaspersky's report highlights the vulnerabilities in IIoT devices. "The security of smart sensors, meters, measuring and control devices, and other devices in the Industrial Internet of Things is typically neglected by both the enterprises using them and, correspondingly, the developers themselves." The report also mentions that smaller facilities often use "inexpensive network equipment...Their cybersecurity can be extremely difficult to keep in good condition."
Cloud Environments: Trend Micro emphasizes the need for cloud security, with solutions for "Cloud asset discovery, vulnerability prioritization, Cloud Security Posture Management, and Attack Surface Management all in one."
Supply Chain Risks: Kaspersky highlights that "the supply chain and network of trusted partners are also very logical potential targets" for attacks focused on innovative companies.

### 3. Importance of Proactive Security Measures

**Attack Surface Management (ASM):** Trend Micro advocates for ASM: "Attack Surface Management Stop breaches before they happen." This proactive approach aims to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
Extended Detection & Response (XDR): Multiple sources highlight the value of XDR, which provides a broader perspective to detect and respond to threats. Trend Micro states that XDR allows to "Stop adversaries faster with a broader perspective and better context to hunt, detect, investigate, and respond to threats from a single platform." Palo Alto also promotes "Cortex XDR" and "AI-Driven Security Operations Platform."
Zero Trust Security: Palo Alto promotes the concept of "Zero Trust Network Access" as a security best-practice, while Trend Micro promotes the more broadly-defined "Secure Service Edge (SSE)" approach, "redefining trust and secure digital transformation with continuous risk assessments".

**Behavioral Rule Protections:** Elastic's bounty program highlights the need for focusing on behavioral analysis of malware, specifically rule protections as opposed to just detecting known signatures.
Vulnerability Management: The Cisco Talos blog reveals vulnerabilities in Whatsup Gold, Observium, and Offis, stressing the need for continuous vulnerability scanning, patching, and regular security updates. They stated that "The vulnerabilities mentioned in this blog post have been patched by their respective vendors..."
Identity Management: OWASP's NHI Top 10 list highlights the critical need to manage non-human identities and machine credentials. "APIs, servers, and applications often require keys and tokens to communicate securely, and improperly managing these can lead to a breach."

### 4. Emerging and Evolving Threats

**AI-Related Threats:** The emergence of generative AI raises concerns about the integrity of online content, as noted in the "Preserving integrity" article which states, "the widespread availability of AI and machine learning tools...means anyone can create or modify data...with minimal effort, low cost, and increased realism." OWASP's NHI Top 10 addresses the need for securing machine identities related to AI, with Kevin Bocek stating, "Are there going to be more machines? Yes. Are there going to be more APIs, microservices? Yes. Are the adversaries going to abuse those? Yes. So this top 10 is important."
Geopolitical Factors: Kaspersky's report notes that "Increasing geopolitical turbulence, sanction wars, and the artificial restriction of access to efficient technology is boosting the drive to violate the intellectual property rights of leading enterprises."
Targeted Attacks: The CL-STA-0048 report provides an example of a targeted espionage campaign against high-value targets in South Asia, highlighting that attackers are adapting to defenses and using advanced techniques. The report concluded: "The CL-STA-0048 campaign represents a significant threat, targeting government and telecom entities in South Asia with a clear focus on espionage."
Obsolete Systems: Kaspersky notes that "[s]ometimes systems have been running for years or even decades without any modifications, even without installing critical security patches or changing insecure configurations...". This introduces vulnerabilities even if the technology is "time-tested."

**Weak PIN Codes:** The Malwarebytes article on the worst PIN codes shows a failure in human security practices: "Too many people use insecure PIN codes to protect important parts of their lives... by trying the first the options in the list ranked by popularity, an attacker can raise his chances of a breach to 11.7 %." The most commonly used PIN is 1234 at 9.0% of all PINs analyzed.
5. Attribution and Threat Actor Analysis

**Chinese Nexus:** The CL-STA-0048 report links the attack to Chinese threat actors: "The threat actor’s use of a Winos4.0-based Downloader leveraging the KCP Protocol could suggest a Chinese origin. The protocol has been historically associated with Chinese threat actors...". The report also mentions that the attackers use "a DNS logging service primarily designed for a Chinese-speaking audience".
Ransomware and Hacktivism: Kaspersky notes that "elite cybercriminal groups – such as top ransomware gangs and hacktivists – are also joining the game, hunting for the leading innovative enterprises’ trade secrets."
Recommendations:

**Prioritize Security:** Organizations must prioritize security as a core business function.
Embrace Proactive Security: Implement proactive security measures such as ASM, XDR and zero-trust architectures.
Strengthen Identity Management: Implement robust processes for managing human and non-human identities (especially related to APIs and cloud-based services).
Continuously Monitor and Update: Regularly update systems, patch vulnerabilities, and monitor for malicious activity.
Invest in Security Awareness Training: Educate users on good security practices, such as using strong PINs and recognizing phishing attempts.
Adapt to New Threats: Stay informed about emerging threats, including those related to AI, and adjust security strategies accordingly.
Focus on Behavioral Analysis: Implement defenses that consider behavior instead of relying solely on signature-based detection.
Secure Supply Chain: Evaluate and manage risks associated with the supply chain.
Conclusion:

The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing, with threats becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. Organizations must adopt a proactive and adaptive security posture to protect their systems and data. Collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement are essential to mitigate the risks presented by the current threat environment.
