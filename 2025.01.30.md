### Cybersecurity Landscape Review - January 30, 2025

## Executive Summary:

This document compiles key cybersecurity trends and incidents reported across various sources on January 30, 2025. The findings highlight an evolving threat landscape characterized by increased exploitation of publicly available resources (like GitHub), vulnerabilities in legacy systems, targeted attacks against specific platforms, and the emergence of sophisticated malware campaigns. A key theme across the board is the continued importance of a layered security approach to counter these threats, including robust detection and response capabilities, proactive vulnerability management, and user education.

## I. Emerging Attack Vectors and Techniques

## GitHub as a Malware Distribution Platform: 
Threat actors are increasingly using GitHub's release infrastructure to host and distribute malware. This tactic leverages the perceived trustworthiness of GitHub for malicious purposes.
"In two separate Lumma Stealer cases, we traced the initial access point to file downloads from GitHubâ€™s release infrastructure."
Malware like the Lumma Stealer is being distributed through files with deceptive names like Pictore.exe and App_aeIGCY3g.exe, downloaded from GitHub-hosted release assets via pre-signed URLs.
The use of pre-signed URLs with short expiration times (e.g., 300 seconds) suggests an attempt to control and authenticate downloads, indicating a more organized malicious campaign.

## Exploitation of Legacy Vulnerabilities: 
Attackers continue to exploit known vulnerabilities in older, often end-of-life (EOL) systems.
A vulnerability in Netgear devices (DGN1000, DGN2200v1) using the setup.cgi script, with no CVE initially but later identified as CVE-2024-12847, is being actively exploited via HTTP GET requests for unauthenticated OS command injection, even though the devices are EOL.
The analysis of the setup.cgi binary reveals standard C library calls, suggesting the attacker is attempting to execute shell commands on the vulnerable devices.

## Web Shells for Post-Compromise Activity: 
There's a significant rise in the use of web shells after initial compromise, indicating a preference for gaining persistent access via vulnerable web applications.
"In 35 percent of incidents in Q4, threat actors deployed a variety of open-source and publicly available web shells against vulnerable or unpatched web applications..."
Web shells, including variants of the Neo-regeorg web shell, are being deployed to gain access and execute commands within compromised environments. Tools like Fuzz Faster U Fool are also employed for brute force and directory discovery.

## HTTP Client Tool Exploitation: 
Attackers are leveraging HTTP client tools for account takeover attempts.
User agents from various HTTP clients (e.g., okhttp, Go-http-client, python-requests) are being used in user enumeration and brute force attacks, highlighting the importance of monitoring atypical HTTP traffic.

## Malicious Google Ads: 
Phishing campaigns are using malicious Google ads to target Microsoft advertisers, demonstrating the continued risk of phishing via search engine results.
A large list of domains was included in the source, indicating an active effort to target Microsoft Ad users.

## II. Notable Malware and Threat Actors

Lumma Stealer: This information-stealing malware is being distributed through GitHub and other means, designed to exfiltrate sensitive data like credentials and cryptocurrency wallets.
The malware uses specific command-line arguments to bypass sandboxing and security tools and exfiltrate information.
The files used are shown to be deployed in conjunction with other malware like SectopRAT and Vidar.
SectopRAT: A remote access trojan (RAT) discovered alongside Lumma Stealer. It appears to use multiple shell commands to establish persistence, evade detection, and exfiltrate data, while utilizing files with names such as PillsHarvest.exe, BelfastProt.exe and HumanitarianProvinces.exe.
Coyote Banking Trojan: Targets Brazilian users, using LNK files with malicious PowerShell commands to ultimately deploy the Trojan and perform credential theft via keylogging, screenshots and phishing overlays.
The trojan includes techniques to avoid sandbox environments and attempts to establish registry persistence.
Tria Stealer: This Android stealer targets users in Malaysia and Brunei, exfiltrating SMS messages and hijacking accounts on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.
Tria Stealer disguises itself as legitimate apps, often related to invitations, and requests extensive permissions. The stolen data is sent to various Telegram bots controlled by the attackers.
The threat actor's tactics share common ground with previous campaigns leveraging "UdangaSteal" malware, suggesting a degree of reuse.
TAG-124 (aka LandUpdate808, 404TDS): A traffic direction system (TDS) used by various threat actors to distribute malware, highlighting the importance of threat actors using these networks to mask their activity and evade detection.
TDS networks redirect web traffic to malicious destinations based on various parameters.
DeepSeek Jailbreaking: The vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek is being highlighted, with successful "jailbreak" techniques such as the "Bad Likert Judge" method being used to illicit harmful responses, particularly around generating keyloggers.
These types of techniques show the need for security and safety for use with LLMs, as these can be bypassed.

## III. Security Best Practices and Technologies

Zero Trust Approach: The sources emphasize the importance of implementing a "never trust, always verify" security model.
Network Detection and Response (NDR): NDR is now viewed as a critical security component, not just a "nice to have." The focus is on reducing incident response times, however, misconceptions about deployment and integration often persist.
Managed Detection and Response (MDR): The need to partner with an MDR provider to provide specialized threat detection, analysis, and containment capabilities is noted.
Endpoint Security Solutions: The need for endpoint security solutions that can detect and prevent malicious execution of shell commands.
Threat Intelligence: Incorporating threat intelligence into security posture, for improved detection and attribution.
Vulnerability Management: The need for regular patching of systems and applications.
User Awareness Training: The critical role of training employees to recognize and avoid phishing, malicious websites, and social engineering tactics.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enabling MFA on all accounts to limit the impact of stolen credentials.
Validation of URLs and Files: The importance of validating URLs and files before downloading and executing, particularly from platforms that can be used to potentially host malware.
Digital Certificate Verification: Checking the validity of digital certificates for executable files is critical to prevent the execution of unsigned malicious software.

## IV. Technical Insights and Vulnerability Details

## COM Object Trapping: 
Research from Project Zero highlights a technique to trap virtual memory access via COM objects. It reveals that type libraries can reference other type libraries, which allows for access to in-process COM classes that are otherwise inaccessible.
While specific exploitable bugs in the StdFont COM class were not found, the potential for injection via hijacking the COM registration is noted.
Furthermore, an issue related to cached signing levels in type libraries is highlighted. This can cause type library failures in protected processes.
Memory Access Trapping: The continued need for memory access traps, especially for TOCTOU bugs in the kernel, has led to the development of various methods to slow down reads or writes of memory addresses.

## V. Cloud Security and Log Analysis

Amazon Redshift Security Enhancement: Amazon Redshift is changing its default behavior in 2025 to enhance security, although the specific changes were not detailed within the provided text.
Amazon OpenSearch and Security Lake Integration: The documentation on deploying Amazon OpenSearch clusters for Security Lake logs details the setup process, including stack parameters, CloudFormation templates, and potential troubleshooting steps.
The document noted potential failures in stack deployment and the ability to troubleshoot these failures using CloudFormation files.
VI. Other Key Points

## Mentorship in Tech: 

The importance of mentorship in shaping careers in tech is emphasized, with a call to both mentors and mentees to "pay it forward".
Evolving Threat Landscape: The sources collectively demonstrate a rapidly evolving threat landscape, where adversaries continuously develop and refine their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to circumvent security controls.

## Conclusion:

The reports from January 30, 2025, paint a picture of a complex and active threat landscape. Attackers are adapting their strategies, including increased exploitation of trusted platforms like GitHub, the utilization of web shells, and sophisticated phishing tactics.
