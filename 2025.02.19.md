# Cybersecurity Threat Briefing: 2025.02.19

## Executive Summary:

This briefing covers a range of cybersecurity topics, including specific ransomware threats, vulnerabilities in software, challenges in email security assessments, the evolution of malware targeting Macs, the use of digital fingerprinting for advertising, and trends in spam and phishing. The documents highlight the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the importance of proactive security measures.

## 1. Ghost (Cring) Ransomware:

### Threat: 
The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC have released a joint advisory regarding Ghost (Cring) ransomware, active since early 2021. "Beginning early 2021, Ghost actors began attacking victims whose internet facing services ran outdated versions of software and firmware."

### Attribution: 
The actors are located in China and conduct widespread attacks for financial gain.

### Targets: 
Victims include critical infrastructure, schools, healthcare, government networks, religious institutions, technology, manufacturing, and SMBs across more than 70 countries.

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers with unapplied patches. "Ghost actors exploit well known vulnerabilities and target networks where available patches have not been applied."
- Use of publicly available code and tools like Cobalt Strike, IOX, SharpShares, SharpZeroLogon, Mimikatz, and web shells.
- Defense evasion by disabling antivirus software (e.g., Windows Defender). "Ghost frequently runs a command to disable Windows Defender on network connected devices."
- Use of encrypted email services (Tutanota, Skiff, ProtonMail, etc.) for communication.
- Data encryption using variants like Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe, often demanding tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency.

### Mitigations:
- Maintain regular, separate system backups.
- Patch known vulnerabilities promptly. "Patch known vulnerabilities by applying timely security updates to operating systems, software, and firmware within a risk-informed timeframe [CPG 2.F]."
- Segment networks to restrict lateral movement.
- Require Phishing-Resistant MFA for access to all privileged accounts and email services accounts.

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
The advisory provides a list of tools used, file hashes, and ransom email addresses for detection purposes.

## 2. Email Security Evaluation:

### Challenges: 
Evaluating email security services requires careful consideration of testing methodologies and potential biases. "Understanding the potential flaws in each approach is essential to making informed decisions and enhancing email security."

### Key Questions:
Funding: Understand who is funding the test and potential biases. "Tests initiated by vendors themselves should be approached with skepticism, as they may manipulate configurations to produce favorable results."

### Other Considerations: 
It is crucial to pose or consider key questions before testing email security solutions.

## 3. Digital Fingerprinting by Google:

### Trend: 
Google is now allowing the use of digital fingerprinting by organizations using its advertising products. "But, per Google’s announcement on December 19, 2024, organizations that use its advertising products can use fingerprinting techniques from last Sunday, February 16, 2025."

### Technique: 
Digital fingerprinting creates a unique digital ID based on various pieces of information collected during browsing, including OS, browser type, IP address, installed plugins, time zone, and language settings.

### Concerns: 
While Google previously considered fingerprinting "undesirable" because users cannot clear their fingerprint, they have now enabled it. The UK ICO reminds businesses that its deployment must be lawful and transparent.

### Mitigation: 
Countering fingerprinting is harder than managing cookies, but users can take steps to make it more difficult to be fingerprinted.

## 4. Spam and Phishing Trends (2024):

### Overall Increase: 
The number of phishing attacks increased in 2024, with Kaspersky solutions blocking 893,216,170 attempts to follow phishing links (26% more than in 2023).

### Geographic Distribution: 
Peru, Greece, and Vietnam were the countries with the highest percentage of users encountering phishing. "Users from Peru (19.06%) encountered phishing most often. Greece (18.21%) ranked second, followed by Vietnam (17.53%) and Madagascar (17.17%)."

### Targeted Organizations: 
Phishing attacks most often targeted web services, internet portals, banks, and online stores. "In 2024, the highest number of attempts to access phishing links blocked by Kaspersky solutions was associated with pages imitating various web services (15.75%), surpassing global internet portals (13.88%), which held the top position in 2023."

### Spam Volume: 
Spam accounted for 47.27% of total global email traffic, up 1.27 p.p. from the previous year.

### Spam Origin: 
Russia, China, and the United States were the top sources of spam.

### Malicious Attachments: 
Common malicious attachments included Agensla stealers, Badun Trojans, and Makoob family malware. "The most common malicious email attachments were Agensla stealers (6.51%), which ranked second last year. Next were Badun Trojans (4.51%), which spread in archives disguised as electronic documents."

### Scam Tactics: 
Scammers are exploiting anticipation for new cryptocurrency launches to steal seed phrases and targeting users of popular games with fake prizes.

### Legal Threats: 
Attackers are using legal threats in emails to trick victims into clicking dangerous links or opening malicious attachments. "Last year, attackers frequently threatened legal action to convince victims to click dangerous links or open malicious attachments."

## 5. Increased Mac Malware Activity:

### Shift in Focus: 
Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting Macs due to their growing presence in businesses.

### Infostealers: 
A new infostealer called Atomic Stealer (AMOS) has emerged, offering its services to other cybercriminals for a monthly fee. "In 2023, a new infostealer on Mac called Atomic Stealer (AMOS) made its debut, and since its launch, it has not only showcased new features—much like TrickBot—it has also been gussied up with some of the markings of a legitimate business."

### Malvertising: 
Cybercriminals are using malvertising techniques to target Mac users based on location, OS, software, and search terms.

### Recommendation: 
Mac users must be vigilant against infostealers and malvertising.

## 6. Malwarebytes Native ARM Support:

### New Capability: 
Malwarebytes has expanded its protection to include ARM-based Windows machines.

### Reasoning: 
ARM processors are gaining popularity due to their performance, battery life, and AI processing capabilities. Malware creators are likely to target this area.

### Recommendation: 
Users of ARM-based Windows devices are encouraged to download Malwarebytes for protection.

## 7. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Vulnerabilities:

### Vulnerabilities: 
Nine vulnerabilities were discovered in the cuobjdump and nvdisasm utilities of NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit.

### Types: 
These vulnerabilities are classified as integer overflows and out-of-bounds reads.

### Impact: 
Exploitation could lead to limited denial of service or limited information disclosure. "Successfully exploiting the associated vulnerabilities might lead to limited denial of service or limited information disclosure."

### Mitigation: 
NVIDIA has released a security update in February 2025 to address these vulnerabilities. Users should update to the latest version.

### Palo Alto Networks Protection: 
Palo Alto Networks NGFW with Advanced Threat Prevention can identify and block command injection traffic related to these vulnerabilities.

## 8. Rapid7's AI-Generated Vulnerability Scoring:

### Improvement to CVE Assessment: 
Rapid7 is using AI to fill in the gaps in the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) process with automatic vulnerability scoring in Exposure Command.

### Conclusion:

The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve with new threats and tactics. Organizations and individuals must stay informed, implement proactive security measures, and keep software updated to protect against these risks.
